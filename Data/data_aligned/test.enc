How is our little Find the Wench A Date plan progressing?

You have my word.  As a gentleman

Sure have.

So that's the kind of guy she likes? Pretty ones?

You know Chastity?

I looked for you back at the party, but you always seemed to be "occupied".

I figured you'd get to the good stuff eventually.

Wow

It's more

Is that woman a complete fruit-loop or is it just me?

Daddy, I want to discuss the prom with you. It's tomorrow night --

No, but

He's not a "hot rod".  Whatever that is.

Fan of a fan.  You see a couple of minors come in?

That I'm used to.

Who is she?

I teach her French, get to know her, dazzle her with charm and she falls in love with me.

Will Bogey get bent?

Assail your ears for one night.

You told me that part already.

Extremely unfortunate maneuver.

And he means that strictly in a non- prison-movie type of way.

What've you got for me?

Cameron -- do you like the girl?

A hundred bucks a date.

But she can't go out with you because her sister is this insane head case and no one will go out with her. right?

You and Verona?

The people at this school are so incredibly foul.

William - he asked me to meet him here.

You hate me don't you?

Then say you'll spend Dollar Night at the track with me.

Come on -- the ponies, the flat beer, you with money in your eyes, me with my hand on your ass...

Excuse me?

I know.  It'd have to be a pretty big deal to get you to mainline tequila. You don't seem like the type.

Oh, so now you think you know me?

Who?

Wholesome.

So what did I have an effect on ?

A soft side? Who knew?

You up for it?

What?

You tell me.

My grandmother's .

Wait I...

Besides, I had some extra cash. Some asshole paid me to take out a really great girl.

As a parent, that's my right

You're eighteen.  You don't know what you want.  You won't know until you're forty-five and you don't have it.

Was that your sister?

So tell me about this dance. Was it fun?

Which parts?

Bianca did what?

You know, fathers don't like to admit that their daughters are capable of running their own lives.  It means we've become spectators.  Bianca still lets me play a few innings.  You've had me on the bleachers for years.  When you go to Sarah Lawrence, I won't even be able to watch the game.

Katarina Stratford.  My, my.  You've been terrorizing Ms. Blaise again.

Am I supposed to feel better? Like, right now?  Or do I have some time to think about it?

I prefer to think of it simply as an alternative to what the law allows.

I missed you.

Why don't we discuss your driving need to be a hemorrhoid?

Unfortunately, Don Colon, that is precisely where our opinions differ...  Are you familiar with the work of Aristotle?  Erathostene?  Ptolemeus?

She said yes.

I understand that you will soon be appointing Governors for the islands?  Is it not so?

How could I be?  The mainland has been found.  Exactly as I said it would.

I want to go with you!

Do you swear on all the Holy Saints in heaven?

I have to explore the mainland.

What does he say?

No...

And were you never ambitious, Excellency?  Or is ambition only a virtue among the nobles, a fault for the rest of us?

... and also to bring medicine.

God... That's in a week!

Why do you wish to sail west?

I believed in you...

New worlds create new people.

I should not even be listening to you, since my council said no.  But Santangel tells me you are a man of honor and sincerity... And Sanchez, that you are not a fool.

We lost cousins, friends.  We will wash this in blood.

In one act of brutality, you have created chaos.  Tribes who were fighting each other are now joining forces against us!  All that because of your criminal savagery!

What do you read?

Where can I meet this man?

We're on the verge of a mutiny, Colon!

Is that the man I knew, Treasurer Sanchez?

Every ship returns with a cargo of sick and dying.  But with no gold! The new world proves expensive, Your Majesty.

I need to know about your background.  I need to know about your upbringing.  Why you're here.

...my little sister and I shared a flat - I came home one night and a man was raping her.  His gun was on the chair... He came at me and I shot him.

I can't take you to my place.

Do you have coffee?

I don't want to drag you down with me.

A cop?

Well, I'm the Deputy Chief Fire Marshall and every now and then I'd like to be included in decisions.

Chief - mind if I take her?

Well this is gonna end your career and probably mine.

Alright.  Swing by her apartment.  Let her pick up her clothes and take her straight to Hoover Street.  You got that?

What's he looking for?

Any I.D.?

Sorry...PD only.

Only one guys checked in?

The other side of the street.  The guy with the videocamera.  Don't look - put her in the car.  Stay this side.

What's wrong?

Tall, short-haired, scary eyes.  Second guy with him was...shorter, with a wrestler's build.  And he wouldn't turn his videocamera off me.

If you found me steppin' on your crime scene - it might piss you off, too.  What about the report?

You thirsty?

She's fucked.  Even if that story is true.

I don't have a girlfriend.

Okay, tell you what, I'll give you a head start.  You take her to the station house.  Don't let her out of your sight. She's the only warm body we got left.

Yeah, just her in the shower.  Nothing happened.  Look, I'm sure you probably think I'm a fool and I fucked up, but...

So...who's Nicky?

I kill someone famous.

Alright.

Hey, honey.

Yes you are.  I'm not just some reporter.  I don't just stick a microphone in your face.  You could give me something.

Oh my G-d, they want me to anchor.  They want me to anchor tonight!

I hope this prick doesn't run.  My knees are killing me.  Stay behind me.

And what do you do with the bones?

If you don't want my film - I'll call another show.  And they will show it.

Were you a fireman?  That how you knew how to rig the apartment?

You can't kill me.  You're not a cop. Just fireman with a gun.  I bet you never shot anybody in your life.

Tell him to put his gun down!

We are both from Prague.

This all you want?

Just do what I do.  Say the same thing I say.  Don't open your mouth.

Did you hear what I said?

What?

How you erase this?

Get in the bathroom!

Let me get a shot of it.

In movie they make of us, who do you think would act me?

I'm serious.

This is my project.  I say 'action.'  I am the director!  You are the talent. You wait for me to say 'action.'  And 'action!'

Emil???!

You've got a call.

I know.

Well, he...

That morning.  He was talking to me and Leon about marriage.

And while they're burning up, they're still goin' down on each other?  You got to hand it to them.

How did you start the fire this time?

The smoke'll permeate your nostrils - burn 'em out.  Let it run.

Now that you know him, maybe you can get extra work in the next movie they make about him.

-- From Czechoslovakia?  And how long have they been livin' in your building?  Alright, I'll be in touch when we know somethin'.  Milos and Tamina Karlova.  They were quiet and kept to themselves.  Landlord don't know who your girl is.

How was it?

CONTINUED

Okay. 

Oh?

No, as a matter of fact, I didn't.

I don't know. All I heard is that there's something about the mission we weren't told.

Yes, I thought so.

I suppose it isn't logically impossible.

Oh, I'm fine, I'm wide awake. What's up?

I guess not.

I'm sorry, Frank, but I don't think I can answer that question without knowing everything that all of you know.

Sorry to interrupt the festivities, Dave, but I think we've got a problem.

Not now, Hal, I'd like to talk to you about something.

Well, don't worry about it.

CONTINUED

CONTINUED

Okay, sweetheart. Have a lovely Birthday Party tomorrow.

Oh, that's such a delightful age.

How do you do, Mr. Miller?

Oh, I really don't have time for a drink. If it's all right I'll just sit for a minute and then I've got to be off.

Well, as it happens, I'm on my way up to the moon

Yes, it does. The sub-surface structure shows that it was deliberately buried about four million years ago.

But you don't have any idea as to what it is?

Has it been exposed to any sun before now?

When do we arrive at Clavius?

What do you mean?

Our Mission Profile calls for Discovery going to Saturn. True or false?

Five by five, Frank.

Roger.

Name?

Maybe after we get done with him I'm gonna buy us some girls.

I'm candy...

Hey, what kind of talk is that?

You're in a hurry.

What's the matter with my place?

Well, maybe I'll see you later ...

You got a name, cop?

You here to write my life story?

Yeah, I noticed...

Luther was part of the gang?

I can read a police file, shithead, and quit calling me Jack.

I got a whole thing about people pointin' guns at me.

What do you think?

You really do have onoe, huh, Jack... what's her problem besides you?

If they kick my ass, they'll sure as hell carve yours up...

I'm gonna enjoy this ... here, I'll even loan you my badge.

This sucks.  A maniac gets hold of my gun and goes all over the streets killing people with it. So, instead of me being where I oughta be, which is in bed giving my girl the high, hard one, I'm out here doing this shit, roaming around with some overdressed, charcoal-colored loser like you.

You?  Don't make me laugh.  You can't take care of shit.  You've been dicking me around since we started on this turd-hunt.  All you're good for is games... So far, what I got outta you is nothin'...

They saved your ass, convict.

Just tell me about the money.

Right, partner.

If I was his size and had Ganz on my ass, I'd  just leave town.

I suppose you'd never be like Luther and let a woman get to you...

Say, do you always work people over like you did Luther?

Yeah, I see her.

Why?

Yeah, well the only woman of the Indian's we ran into was shacked up with her dyke girlfriend.  I guess she went with him before she came outta the Closet ... They both looked mad enough to kill him...

What if your girl's theory turns out to be bullshit?  I mean, they could be in Rio de Janeiro.

Okay, reggie, start bustin' my chops... Tell me how great you were with that chick.

Don't duck the bullet Cates. Why didn't you call in for backup instead of makin' a grandstand play?

But that's what you say about all of us all the tine ... we're always the ones fucking up when you tell it...

Billy Bear...

You look awful.

Long night, too, from what I heard ... Word's going around that in addition to losing Ganz for the second time, and in addition to Haden busting you back to Patrolman, some jig beat the crap out of you.

Doesn't look like it.

Bullshit red tape.

Hey, you're right.

I'm all wet.

You know, if you let me come over to your place once in a while, you could put on a clean shirt in the morning.

When you start with that attitude... it's like I don't know who you are.

Look, Jack, if you make everything your personal responsibility, you'll turn into a bad cop.  It's not a practical way to function...

Just one.  Some lady called.  Said she's a little hot-headed sometimes... But she still wants her occasional roommate. She'd like to talk it over after she gets off work tonight... if it's humanly possible....

I'm at work, asshole.  Where else?

I can see that.  Pardon me for saying so, but you look like shit.  What happened?

You real down?

You're impossible...

Who the hell are you?

Hey, two days with him is enough.

He was the only one of my bunch that was my friend... He was loyal, went all the way for you...

How hot are they?

Instead of worryin' about Reggie, you better worry about me...

Billy, go ahead, break it...

You chickenshit punk...

Come on, you can trust me. Please.

Rosalie, you okay?

How you doing, man?

Appipulai Leeloo Minai..

...We're saved!

Father, by creating a little destruction, I am, in fact, encouraging life!  So, in reality, you and I are in the same business!

You are a monster, Zorg!

There's not a moment to lose! Wake her up, but be gentle about it!  This woman is mankind's most precious possession! She is... perfect!

I'm sorry to have to resort to such methods, but we heard about your good luck on he radio and we need the tickets to Fhloston.

We have to save the world.

Did you see that..thing..swallow our battleship like a gum drop?  You can't even tell me what it is! I ask you for options you give me bullshit. Give them permission to enter our territories with my warmest regards.

It's a miracle!!!

Father, will you please explain what's going on?

I don't have time... I need to know.

I'm sorry, but... the Stones...

At least, the cat comes back.

Uh... at least fifty.

Finger..man..I'm sorry..listen..I was on the way over but I had a fare fall into my lap.. y'know one of those big fares you just can't resist..

Knowing mankind as I do, that could take centuries!

Other than that... You all right?

Welcome on board Mr. Dallas..

Fuel level 6.03..Propulsion 2x4...

30 seconds...

Six to the left. One to the right.

Major Dallas, if our calculations are correct you still have 57 hours owed to the Federal Army on your enlistment which is more than you will need for a mission of the utmost importance.

You couldn't come up with something a little more discreet?

I'm not going.

Apipoulai!

Finished what?

You can sleep tomorrow... come on...

...Like love...

Isn't that a Z140? Alleviated titanium. Neuro charged assault model?

Thanks..

Staedert?  What's going on?  Did you destroy it?

How's that? Can you hear me better now?

Who gives a shit! I didn't come here to listen to music! Listen up instead of running off at the mouth! The batteries on my phone are almost gone.

Your clothing reeks of it.

Okay, I believe you.

How's the detective business?

It's a missing persons case... a long shot.  I'll give it two months, two months at most, then I'll be back.  We'll take a vacation.

I'm okay.  Please, honey, I can't explain.  Don't use the phone, just pack a bag and get out.  I'm on my way.  I'll be back at the house in three hours.  Call me from the hotel when you get there

You owe me an explanation.  You can't treat me like this.

You know where I can get it?  I have a lot of money to spend.

What's the problem?

You brought the money?

Excellent.

I figured you share information.

They were pretty clear they didn't want this coming back on them.

Yeah, who's this?

What the fuck are you.. ?

Show me where you did it, on the map, exactly where you did it.

Made me sick, but what did I care? What did I care if some hump wants to beat off to that.  It was just something I was doing for money.

What do you want to know?  You saw it, you saw the loop...

I never killed anyone.

You know how my tapes sell.  People eat this stuff up.

Maybe there's something wrong with the scumbag customers coming into your place, ever think of that?

You are a private investigator?

Must have paid you a lot, for you to risk everything.  Would've had to have cut yourself a real nice piece of money.

Truman Capote.

How long you been working there?

Well, there's the thing; you're not gonna know anything about what I'm doing, but you can make some money.

Here's my number if you need it...  When can you start?

... Hello... ?

You've got Penthouse, Playboy, Hustler, etc.  Nobody even considers them pornography anymore.  Then, there's mainstream hardcore.  Triple X.  The difference is penetration. That's hardcore.  That whole industry's up in the valley. Writers, directors, porn stars. They're celebrities, or they think they are.  They pump out 150 videos a week.  A week.  They've even got a porno Academy Awards.  America loves pornography.  Anybody tells you they never use pornography, they're lying.  Somebody's buying those videos.  Somebody's out there spending 900 million dollars a year on phone sex.  Know what else?  It's only gonna get worse.  More and more you'll see perverse hardcore coming into the mainstream, because that's evolution.  Desensitization.  Oh my God, Elvis Presley's wiggling his hips, how offensive!  Nowadays, Mtv's showing girls dancing around in thong bikinis with their asses hanging out.  Know what I mean?  For the porn-addict, big tits aren't big enough after a while.  They have to be the biggest tits ever.  Some porn chicks are putting in breast implants bigger than your head, literally.  Soon, Playboy is gonna be Penthouse, Penthouse'll be Hustler, Hustler'll be hardcore, and hardcore films'll be medical films. People'll be jerking off to women laying around with open wounds. There's nowhere else for it to go.

There's two kinds of specialty product; legal and illegal.  Foot fetish, shit films, watersports, bondage, spanking, fisting, she- males, hemaphrodites... it's beyond hardcore, but legal.  This is the kind of hardcore where one guy's going to look at it and throw up, another guy looks at it and falls in love.  Now, with some of the S+M and bondage films, they straddle the line.  How are you supposed to tell if the person tied up with the ball gag in their mouth is a consenting or not?  Step over that line, you're into kiddie porn.  Rape films, but there aren't many.  I've never seen one.

You just strike me as smart enough to be doing something else.

You're telling me it doesn't get to you?

A daughter.

Consider it.  Meanwhile, dig up whatever Dino Velvet films you can. Get receipts.  I'll call back.

Who is he?

Who is he, his name?

I know if I had to pick, it'd be "Choke," or "Devil."

He's odd.

I've spoken to friends of mine and my husband's, in Harrisburg, in Lancaster and Hershey.  Asking about you.  I must say you have friends in influential places.

As you know, my husband passed away recently.  Two weeks ago now.

Pittsburgh?

He succeeded.

Please, believe me.  This is probably a stag film.  Simulated rape.  Hard to stomach, and it might seem real, but there are ways of making it look realistic... fake blood and special effects...

One was for two hundred thousand, one dollar and thirteen cents. Another was for three hundred thousand, six hundred fifty four dollars and seventy six cents...

Hello... ?

You told me to look, so I looked.

Hello?

I've got about five thousand left in cash, but I'll need another thirty, if you approve.

I'm sorry, let me explain, the R.C.M.P. is a support organization and archive, not unlike the Center for Missing and Exploited Children in Washington.  I'm sure you've dealt with them before?

She just seemed... depressed... ?

What was she running from?

I didn't mean to...

I... I shouldn't take anymore of your time.  Maybe we can finish tomorrow.  I'll call tomorrow...

Are you religious?

Hello... ?

What are you talking about... ?

Mrs. Mathews, your daughter is dead. She's dead.

Whatever possessed you to keep this all this time?

No, sir, he is not.

The um... you'll find my invoice in the envelope. If that's all...

Alice, you think you can leave?

Doesn't the dream master work for you anymore?

I can't go back to sleep again.

You what?

Kristen, what happened?

Rick stayed later after school with Kristen.  She wasn't feeling very well.

I thought it was an accident.  Smoking in bed.

Alright, let's assume this whole thing is true. Why does Freddy all of a sudden need you?

As long as your driving doesn't kill us.

He's going after Debbie.  I gotta stop him.

What the hell was that?

I don't get it.

Nice neighborhood.

Honey, we went over this in therapy.

Something wrong with the stairs?

Look, I appreciate what you're offering, but no.  He is my responsibility.

We know you've been through a lot but there's more than your feelings at stake here.

No you're not.  You don't even care about being a mom.  How come you don't think about me?

There you go.  Love you.

That's in the past.  Unless you've stopped going to the meetings.

Thanks for everything, Dad.

I'm so sorry, honey...

You disappointed in me?

Have you visited the little boy on my floor?  Jacob, the one who looks kind of sad?

Did everyone call everyone?

Are you alright?

He sure loves to stay awake.

My dad's got this thing about drinking in the house.

Mark, are you okay?

Meet me later.  Milkshakes.  Cherry pie. Banana splits.  And no mom!

Have another one, sounds like you need it.

Look.  Dan's parents were pushing him. Pushing him hard.  He was bitching about it at the party last night.  He was under pressure.  We all are.

Bottom line, Alice.  Anybody, supernatural or not, that wants to hurt you - he'll have to go through us first.

How is he - ?

You 'trade school boys' are all alike, aren't you?  Anybody who doesn't happen to think like a little gold-braided puppet is, ipso facto, a coward!

Unidentified Flying Objects.

Now, Dave Old Buddy, you know you're exaggerating -  What do you think of this husband of yours?  On most boats a certain loyalty exists between the Exec and his Navigation and Firing Officer.  But unfortunately, in the case of Lieutenant Dave Milburn of the Tiger Shark and myself -

At the worst possible moment. Tomorrow is Janie's birthday. Poor little kid has looked forward for two months to having her Daddy home.  Now -

So all of a sudden his only son drops out of school, be- gins making noises like a pacifist.  A real egghead, do-gooder, and crackpot!  'Ban the atom tests!  Junk the nuclear subs!  Spend the mili- tary budgetfor peace!'

Cyclops?

We're stuck tight!

Yeah?

You hear that?

Wonder where Powell and Carney are?

Dave - !

A mass of jelly-like stuff came out of the thing, and caught our torpedo!

You better take Powell and Carney with you --

Excuse me, Skipper---

Excuse me, Captain - there may be one last, desperate chance - a one-in-a-thousand shot...

We took for granted his source of energy was nuclear.  But suppose it isn't at all - what if it's <u>magnetic</u>?

The radiation level - from the saucer - it's rising!

Straight to the Pole - at almost fifty knots!

What's the corrected bearing to the Magnetic Pole?

Why?

Well, I'll be - !

Cyclops will have to linger at the Pole to recharge his power banks.

You got yourself a computer, Alma.

I know he's due for the last two years. I was thinking of paying it when the insurance comes in.

I went down to Concord to check it out. The president is Mel Gordon. The vice-president and treasurer is Gordon LaRiviere. Those boys are buying up the mountain, Wade. $364,000 this year. I believe that's out of LaRiviere's league.

What are you boys up to?

LaRiviere says he ain't gonna pay for the fixin' of your car. A couple hundred for the clutch. I got some more bad news. Wanna hear it?

Maybe I can buy him off. I gotta talk to Mel.

You might not kill it.

Don't mind if I do.

No brag. Just fact.

I thought I told you to move that truck!

You gotta be more careful about that shit. Gordon or one of those guys sees you smoking that wacky tabacky around me they'll expect me to bust you. And I'll be outta a job.

Yeah, he'd go broke tomorrow if you quit him.

No, I mean whereabouts.

Where'd you get the blood?

Saw him do it?

You musta seen him get shot. I know you did.

There's your old twenty-gauge, and that there's the new Browning you was showing me last night. This must be Twombley's gun. Brand new. Very fancy tooling. Probably fired one time. It's a beautiful piece of work.  But what the hell, Jack, I guess you deserve it. Right's right.

Those are the Hoyts.

You know.

Was it funny?

Go on, Jill. Some of those kids you still know.

No what?

She's gone already!  Gone already! Couldn't wait.

C'mon, we can always sneak a Big Mac. And a cherry turnover. Your favorite. What do you say?

I don't know. For the food business. I guess. I just thought, you know, we'd sneak a Big Mac on Mommy, like we used to.

Told you the snow was coming down. Take the grader.

Don't go playing policeman.

Get the grader. Go out 29 past Toby's. Don't let Lillian get to you. She didn't belong here. That's why she left.

He more than likely just shot himself in the foot or something. That's what usually happens.

What the fuck. My day's already ruined.  Give me the keys. You can go back with Jack. You still got a shitload of plowing to do.

I saw Mel Gordon in here this morning.

Want to buy?

Wade, you're done.  Let me have the shop keys.

The key, Wade.

Lillian!

While you went off for a few beers with your friends? Is that Hettie Rodgers there, with whatzizname?

I don't want her to go, Lillian.

It's just...

Wait there. She'll be right out.  Is there snow on the ground up in Lawford?

Low as what? What have I done? It's bad to want to see your own daughter?

I'm sorry about what I said.

About you and Jill and needing a third person. She went back to Lillian?

Lots of people. Guy like Evan Twombley, Boston union official, probably got lots of people want to see him dead. The Government's been investigating his links with the Mafia.

Yeah, but never what you looked like. Not really. Never really studied your face, like now. I was never able to see you as a kid when you were a kid until now, this way.

After making love. I like it. It's nice to see that in a grown-up person.

Then... I guess you have to.

This is nuts.

What happened?

What the hell are you talking about?

Hold on!

Mrs. Gordon. Thank you.

It don't look right.

Wade, I got a message for you.  Jack Hewitt, he's looking for you. Wants you to clear your stuff out of his office in Town Hall.

Well, I guess -- that's what he said.

Rolfe.

What was that?  You got something to say, say it! Say it!

Is there something wrong with the phone?

Pop, for Christ's sake!

Who?

Anyone else want one? Rolfe?

What about Margie?

I know what it means. I'm just running out of ways to use it.

It's not like he hasn't made us wait a few times.

You don't want to say hi to your father?

We'll talk at home.  You know, most girls aren't as lucky as you.  For most girls seeing the Bolshoi ballet would be the experience of a lifetime.

He's in a meeting.  He can't be disturbed.

I know...  But lotsa times I feel like it's me versus the world.  Some kid at school teases me and the same day a plague breaks out in Bangladesh.  I mean it doesn't take a genius to figure which is more important.

You're right and I'll tell you a secret.  I know exactly how you feel.

I don't drink coffee.

Yeah, I study world events. Five thousand Turkienistan Muslims were slaughtered in Stravanvitch's cleansings... along with 15 American school kids. You know hQw I studied that. I went to their funerals with my dad. I met their parents.

Do you see the maintenance panel?

U.S. Pilots, this is Air Force One.

Got it.

He's dead then. They must have killed him.

Walter, if you have a point, make it.

Can we do that?

If challenged, our fighters are to state that they are on a rescue mission.

How many others killed?

Remarkable aircraft. Remarkable.

We copy. Stand by...  Tower?

Ms.  Mitchell.  So nice to finally meet you in person.

*                     Please tell me your name.

Fear will keep you alive. Any one who is not afraid is bound to do something foolish, and bound to die.

But they are not ny people. You look at me as if I am a monster, but answer me this -- when your planes bombed the oil fields of Iraq, did You cry for those dark skinned men whose names you do not know and who's faces You will never see? Did You cry for their wives and children. They were people too, yes... but they were not your people.

Now since we've had very little luck getting Washington or Moscow to cooperate, I wondered if you would be so kind.

Someday, you'll regret my nature.

Our only policy assumes the plane is on the ground. Our hands are completely tied while they're in the air.

Our KH-ll's took this one at 0100 hours. What you see here is the mobilization of two mechanized brigades.

We've already played our cards, Major. There's no turning back.

For godsakes, Jim, slow down and stop acting like the little dutch boy.  Not even you can plug all the world's leaks.  Don't you think it's a sign you're pushing too hard when your daughter sees more of you on MTV news than in person.

How do you know she understands? You haven't spent more than five minutes with her, or me, in weeks.

You know what?

I'll make it up to you, I promise.

How did your speech go?

What are you doing?

The fax machines.

One.

who can I say is calling?

Yeah, right.

Okay... if you're the President, when's your wife's birthday?

I said it's not worth the fight.  Steward, please.

You give me ulcers.

Defense and State Department in the conference room in one hour.  I want to review the Iraq situation.

Mr. President... they're ready for you in the conference room.

IT'S OPEN!

You handle your front office people, I'll handle the press and leave the boys in Washington to the boys downtown and the boys downtown to the boys on the board.

What?

Forget it.  I was reading.

Elaine.

Ted, what's wrong?

Elaine.

Elaine, what happened to us?

Ted, get a grip on yourself.  You should never have left the hospital.

I've never used the word insane, Ted.

Elaine!

Now!

Ted seemed to get worse after I told him about Simon, Doctor.

Who would believe that Elaine Thompson was once a stewardess on the Denver-Chicago run.

Women <u>and</u> the space program have come a long way, sweetheart.  But after the wedding, no more complicated computers for my little girl.

Frank's the best pilot in the program.

I guess this is a first for you.

Simon, I didn't want it to end like this. We can be friends!  You'll die out there.

I'd rather sit down for this one, Elaine.

That's not possible.

Will Scraps be able to sit with us, Dad?

Joey, what's more important, the kids' clothes or your sexual potency.

Joe, the insurance policy won't help your wife and kids.  You bought auto insurance, not life insurance.

That's how dry cleaning works.  Now I'd like to quickly go over the digestive system of amphibians.

Say, isn't that Dr. Barrington, the world- renowned agronomist?

I have to see Bud Kruger.

You can't go in there!

Love's the same as it always was.  It's people who change.

After my wife died, I felt like a fifth wheel. You know, so many years being with one person -- a very wonderful person -- makes you always think of yourself as part of a pair...When Ethel passed away, I was lost. I couldn't function socially and I couldn't function in business.

...but after...awhile...you begin to...  ...get used to it.

Both pilots!

What is it, Doctor? What's happening?

You'd better tell the Captain. We've got to land as soon as we can. This woman has to be gotten to a hospital.

Elaine, you're a member of this crew. Can you face some unpleasant facts?

All right. Unless I can get all these people to a hospital quickly, I can't even be sure of saving their lives. Now, is there anyone else on board who can land this plane?

Mostly I remember...the nights when we were together. I remember how you used to hold me...and how I used to sit on your face and wriggle...and then afterwards how we'd watch until the sun came up. When it did, it was almost like...like each new day was created...only for us.

I think they're getting the hang of it! When we re-enlist I'll teach them baseball!

Good-bye, darling.

So long, darling. Good-bye. Take care of yourself.

What did you think of 'Great Expectations?'

Yes?

Sorry, Clarence. Latest weather report shows everything socked in from Salt Lake to Lincoln.

No, he's not bothering anyone. Let him stay up here.

There's a little girl on board who's ill and...

Fourteen-B. It's halfway down on your right.

Do you feel all right, sir?

You are Cassandra?

You don't have squat.

Look at your dildo partner.  He's too scared to even come down to the sand.  You're not gonna get wet standing here, moron!

William Harcourt?

I'm Sergeant Sykes, and this is Detective Jetson, Los Angeles Police Department.

That cop, the human, he was the one who killed Anderson and the driver.

When we picked him up, he was talking to those two cops -- the two who came to question you about Hubley.

Let's talk Hubley.

With two BRI Sabot slugs in the chest.

Get the picture?

Newcomers working near methane gasses at oil refineries must paint it on their boots to protect against sparks.

Rudyard Kipling?  No shit?  Listen, we just need a minute of your time...

Screw you.

Matthew, you don't have to-- .

I'll bet.  Would it really put you out if they tossed that on the grill for a minute or two?

Who is he?

We were chasing you because you ran, you dumb son-of-a-bitch.

So, she keeps you on a pretty short leash, does she?

I'm going home.

Well, let's roll, George.

... So we've got three guys dead. All Newcomers, all killed the same way -- execution style.

What's this nothing shit?  It wasn't nothing yesterday when you asked Bentner to run that test and he looked like he was about to shit peach pits, and it's not nothing now.  Don't lie to me, George, you're bad at it.

We?  You've taken it?

Where did he get it?  Was there any of it on the ship?

George... look me in the eye... George, you don't ever lie to me again.

They had months in quarantine to develop the plan.  Porter, with his chemistry background, must have somehow come up with the formula for the drug.  Hubley manufactured it -- at the refinery.  Strader, through the nightclub, established a distribution network.  And Harcourt--

Okay, George -- we gotta play this real smart.

Uh, George...

With Harcourt and Kipling dead, I assume you will be requesting reassignment now.

Why the hell are you so dead set against back-up?

You said you wanted the biggest thing I could find... Well, this is it.

Yeah, the shells are too big for six in an cylinder.  Hell, Matt, you don't need but one.

You think this is the guy who did it?

Can you dig up their Quarantine records in this thing?

Yeah, right.  Don't push your luck. Anyway, according to the sheet, the guy you nailed outside by the car--

You guys finished the postmortem on Strader yet?

How can I go?

Movement!

Okay, let's do it.

First squad up, on line.  Hicks, get yours in a cordon.  Watch the rear.

Flame-units only.  I want rifles slung.

Uh,...Apone, I want you to lay down a suppressing fire with the incinerators and fall back by squads to the APC, over.

It's going to be closer.  You better get going.

You did okay, Bishop.

Fifty-seven...oh, Christ...

Amy.

You had them eating out of your hand, kiddo.

Yeah, yeah.  I saw the commercial.

It's all I could get.  Anyway, it keeps my mind off of... everything.  Days off are worse.

That the atmosphere processor?

You son of a bitch.

You've been doing your homework. Look, they can't impound it if they don't know about it.

I expected more of you, Ripley. I thought you would be smarter than this.

I told them to fall back...

What's the question?

Are there any questions?  Hudson?

We got problems.

Seventeen meters.

They'll get us.

Look, you started this.  Now show me everything.  I can handle myself.

Locked.

Hey, Vasquez...you ever been mistaken for a man?

All right, we can't blow the fuck out of them...why not roll some canisters of CN-20 down there. Nerve gas the whole nest?

Yeah, bullshit.  Watch us.

It's inside the complex.

This service tunnel is how they're moving back and forth.

We need the other drop-ship.  The on one the Sulaco.  We have to bring it down on remote, somehow.

I don't care how!  Think of a way.  Think of something.

Just terrible?  That's better than yesterday at least.

What did you say?

They'd be here if they could, honey.  I know they would.

I guess we're not leaving, right?

Now you just lie here and have a nap.  You're exhausted.

I don't know, Newt.  That's the truth.

Gone.

Mommy...Mommy?

The analysis team which went over your shuttle centimeter by centimeter found no physical evidence of the creature you describe...

Why won't you check out LV-426?

Maestro.

Well? How do you like it? It's Turkish. My hairdresser tells me everything's going to be Turkish this year!

How do you know?

Why not?

Oh!

Turkish? Oh, if it's Turkish, that's different. I want to be in it.

What?

Oh - excuse me!

I'm not surprised. Money seems to be more important to him than loyalty or friendship. He has sold himself to Vienna. Let Vienna look out for him.

You have leave to try.

Humiliated?

Don Giovannnnnnnni!

Your Grace, I've got something to tell you. I want to complain about this man.

Oh, ha, ha, ha.

Yes, you are. You're very sick.

Iram - marry Em - marry me! No, no! You're a fiend. I'm not going to marry a fiend. A dirty fiend at that.

One royal pupil and the whole of Vienna will come flocking. We'd be set up for life!

Well, I'm not borrowing any more money from my mother, and that's that!

Yes!

Salzburg.  We were just talking about Salzburg.  If you've come from my friend the Fartsbishop, you've arrived at just the right moment. Because I've got good news for him. I'm done with Vienna. It's over, finished, done with! Done with! Done with!

Half the house! You'll never see a penny. I want it here, in my hand.

Who was that?

Go back to bed.

Frau Mozart?

Then he didn't send you?

Are you sure you can't leave that music, and come back again? I have other things you might like.

It is miraculous.

No, he doesn't. And I don't want you here. Just go, please.

I'm paying people just to wait for you. It's ridiculous!

What is ridiculous? Wolfi has many admirers in Vienna. They love him here. People send us gifts all the time.

And so you do! The only time you come out is to eat.

Oh, now I'm a bad housekeeper!

Be careful!

Hey!

Perhaps a little refreshment first? A little coffee, or a little chocolate?

May I try it?

A-flat, Majesty.

My pleasure.

Well, I'm glad to hear that.

I have to tell you, Mozart is not entirely to be trusted alone with young ladies.

Well, what is it about? Tell us the story.

My dear, young man, don't take it too hard. Your work is ingenious. It's quality work. And there are simply too many notes, that's all. Cut a few and it will be perfect.

Majesty, this is Madame Weber. She is my landlady.

Really? How delightful. May I ask when you marry?

Majesty, may I ask you to do me the greatest favour?

Guess! Guess, Majesty. Imagine the longest time such a thing could last, then double it.

Yes, what about him?

I write to you with urgent news. I am coming to Vienna. Take no further steps toward marriage until we meet. You are too gullible to see your own danger. As you honour the father who has devoted his entire life to yours, do as I bid, and await my coming.

Feed? Well, of course she feeds me. She stuffs me like a goose all day long. She's the best cook in the world. I mean, since Mama. Just wait, you'll see.

What do you mean? It's wonderful. Really, it's - it's marvelous! People love me here.

Pupils?

I don't know. It's not important. I mean, I don't want pupils. They get in the way. I've got to have time for composition.

Isn't that marvelous? We're delighted.

Yes, Papa, name it. Name it. I'll do anything you say!

Don't worry, I'm not staying here to be a burden.

Ah! Here she comes. Fraulein Lorl, good morning.

Oh, I wouldn't know that, sir.

Is he working?

Is he working?

Yes?

Well?

Quiet! Quiet! Quiet! Down there, damn you.  Welcome to you. Pay no attention, they're impossible. Stop it, you willful things! Come this way. Just ignore them. They're perfectly harmless, just willful. I treat them just like my own children.

I'm afraid I am.

Good morning, Fraulein Schlumberg.

Well, this is hardly the way to go about it.

I'm sorry. No.

Dear Mozart, my sincere congratulations.

Herr Mozart, what brings you here?

So you are. How is your pretty wife?

Look, I must have pupils. Without pupils I can't manage.

I'd better not. It's a bit of a secret.

Wolfgang, what is it? Sta calmo, per favore. What's the matter?

You burned the score?

But there are those who have power over him. I think I'll take this up with the Emperor.

With all my heart, Mozart.

It's the best opera yet written. I know it! Why didn't they come?

A man who deserved a Requiem Mass and never got one.

I am only a messenger. Do you accept? You will be paid well.

What happened? Is it over?

You mean she's not coming back?

Oh no. It is a sublime piece. The grandest operone. I tell you, you are the greatest composer known to me.

Are you ill?

Confutatis Maledictis.

The Fire.

Now the orchestra. Second bassoon and bass trombone with the basses. Identical notes and rhythm.  The first bassoon and tenor trombone -

Do you have me?

Yes, and on 'dictis'.

Would you stay with me while I sleep a little?

Oh? Have I seen it?

What are you doing, Herr Director?

What is this, Herr Chamberlain?

Why do I have to submit samples of my work to some stupid committee? Just to teach a sixteen-year-old girl.

Is the Emperor angry with me?

Naturally, the Italians! Of course! Always the Italians!

About what?

What do you want?

Do you know who I am? You never heard of me, did you?

How well are you trained in music?

Where?

Oh, I know that! That's charming!  I didn't know you wrote that.

Of course. The man you accuse yourself of killing.

Do you hear me?

It was incomprehensible. What was God up to? Here I was denying all my natural lust in order to deserve God's gift and there was Mozart indulging his in all directions - even though engaged to be married! - and no rebuke at all! Was it possible I was being tested? Was God expecting me to offer forgiveness in the face of every offense, no matter how painful? That was very possible. All the same, why him? Why use Mozart to teach me lessons in humility? My heart was filling up with such hatred for that little man. For the first time in my life I began to know really violent thoughts. I couldn't stop them.

Yes, Father. Yes! So much for my vow of chastity. What did it matter? Good, patient, hard-working, chaste - what did it matter? Had goodness made me a good composer? I realized it absolutely then - that moment: goodness is nothing in the furnace of art. And I was nothing to God.

All I ever wanted was to sing to Him. That's His doing, isn't it? He gave me that longing - then made me mute. Why? Tell me that. If He didn't want me to serve Him with music, why implant the desire, like a lust in my body, then deny me the talent? Go on, tell me! Speak for Him!

But not his body.

You mean that play?

Where?

Ballet? What ballet?

Yes, absolutely. Is there a ballet in Figaro?

I've taken pity on you, my angel. I heard your wish.

Excuse me, sir, there is a lady who insists on talking to you.

Well, tell him we were here, won't you?

How did he look?

Dr. Hirsch, Mr. Kessler cried out a minute ago.

Can I be of service, Miss Price?

Oh, Miss Price?

Did he say a wolf?

He's not?

Yes.

Surely you're not suggesting...

Yes, he is. He's very excited and confused, but he's not crazy, if that's what you mean.

No, why?

You put me in an awkward position, Mr. Kessler.

Aw come on, Miss Price!

Let's try a little harder, shall we?

I'm sorry. I shouldn't have asked you.

David, your dreams will stop. You'll leave England and your bad memories; and then this will all fade away.

What?

All I am to you is a sex fantasy then?

Closet.

Will you be here in about fifteen minutes?

But, David.

Let me go now, you'll make me late.

Listen, if you get too anxious, call me at the hospital, okay?

David! Where on earth have you been!?!

He's playing a stupid joke, sir.

Leave me alone, dammit! You people are crazy! I've got to get away from here! I've got to do something!

No what?

The doctor will be round later. Would you like a picture book to look at? We have some lovely funny Beanos.

Miss Price.

Who is this girl?

Why are you doing this to me, Jack?

That's easy for you to say - you're already dead.

Oh, all right. There was this airplane over the Atlantic on its way to New York. It was full of men from the United Nations.

How long have I been here?

Lunatic?

How could there have been witnesses? It was so dark. We were running and I fell and Jack went to help me up and this thing came from nowhere... I don't understand what they're talking about.

You'd be surprised what horrors a man is capable of.

No. In fact, your wounds were cleaned and dressed before you arrived here.

Dr. Hirsch?  I'd rather not be by myself.

David, before we go in there I want you to know that - no matter what happens to us - it's your fault.

What about it?

Listen, that's a pentangle, a five- pointed star. It's used in witchcraft. Lon Chaney, Jr. and Universal Studios maintain it's the mark of the wolf man.

Beware the moon?

Could be a lot of things.

Shit! David, what is that?

It sounds far away.

So you know what she does? She's so grief stricken she runs to find solace in Rudy Levine's bed.

What's wrong with you? Shut up!

Beware the moon. The full moon, David. You've got two days.

David, please believe me. You will kill people, David. You've got to stop the bloodshed before it begins.

Okay, you've seen me. Now go away.

A monster. I know, I know.

I think I've lost my mind. I think you're not real. I think I'm asleep and you're a part of another bad dream.

What can I say, Jack?

I didn't mean it. I don't know what I'm saying. I'm not even sure it was me who killed those people. I don't remember doing it.

Well, even if I'm not the wolfman, I am crazy enough to do something like that. I mean, here I sit in Leicester Square talking to a corpse. I'm glad to see you, Jack.

Dr. Hirsch?

Yes?

Sorry, love.

No, thank you.

He may have a point, Lieutenant. Two strong boys would be able to defend themselves against one man.

What do you suppose anybody wants? Money, money, money!

Where's Matt?

Yeah. He'll have a tough time thinking up a wise-crack for this one . . .

Where you been?

Personally, I think you're getting panic-stricken about nothing. Dickson's all right.

Say, you know, I found out something yesterday about hitting a golf ball. You've got to hit with the left hand, and from the inside out, it's the only way you can hit anything

What's the matter with my policy? How many losses has this bank taken in the last twenty-five years?  I'll tell you. Not a single one!  What's wrong with that kind of banking?

We'll be forced to shut the doors. I've worked twenty-five years night and day to keep this bank alive. You've all made money out of it. Are you willing to help?

No. You can't reason with anyone else when you're in a jam. We pleaded with you to keep liquid, but you wouldn't listen to us. You preached to us about faith and a lot of other rubbish. Now you want our help. You want us to throw a lot of cash into a bank that you've wrecked. All right. There's one way you can get it. Give us an option on your stock and resign as president.

I was crazy, I tell you, Mr. Dickson. I didn't know what I was doing. I wandered around in a daze. All I could think of was that they were going to kill me . . .  You'll stand by me, won't you, Mr. Dickson? You won't go back on me now, will you? I'll die if they send me to prison!

What happened?  You're not a thief. How'd you get mixed up with these kind of people?

You know what we do to welchers, Cluett, don't you?

That don't do us any good.

What is the matter with you? You're trembling?

For a celebrated bounder, that is an awful admission. Besides, I never knew that any female could do this to you .

Not bad, not bad at all. Do you know something? I've always been curious about your line.

But I'm giving a party for him - a real, old-fashioned surprise party. Caps, bells, whistles, and everything. I'm really terribly excited about it. I've been planning it for months.

Well, what?

You know, there ought to be a Congressional Medal for men like you. America's comfort to misunderstood wives. I never thought I would find myself in that class.

What is that, Mr. Bones?[7]

Well, I thought I'd like to have a little talk with you.

I tell you, I'm not interested in your opinion.

Phyllis, you don't have to explain anything.  You'd do well to mind your own business.

The theatre?

Yes, of course.

All right. I'll postpone the whole thing until tomorrow night.

Listen, dear. Now tell me the truth about this. Were you in Cluett's apartment?

Good morning.

But, Mr. Dickson, I thought you were going to take care of the mortgage. I only want ten thousand. The property is worth sixty.

Oh, make that uniform blue.

Looks good. How much did it cost?

Wait a minute. Wait a minute.  Matt, do you realize you're up against something? You're being charged with murder. It's serious, son. Now come on, I know you didn't do it.  But we've got to make them believe it. Come on, tell the truth, where were you last night?

Oh, I can explain about that later. You're losing your bank - don't you realize what that means?

Listen, Mr. Dickson, don't let them lick you just because a couple of big shots turned you down. You've got more friends than anybody in this town. Little guys - guys who wouldn't be in business if it weren't for you. All you've got to do is

Aw, I don't know what you're talking about. All I know is that you're losing your bank and

Helen, while you're downtown, you might stop in and make reservations for the bridal suite on the Berengaria sailing next week.

All right. If the boy proves an alibi, he's all right, isn't he?

All I know is the bank's been robbed and a murder's been committed. The way I see it, Brown here looks guilty.

Of course it's true - and he knows it.

You were right, Mr. Dickson! Brown didn't have anything to do with it. Here's your man.

That's just exactly what he has been doing. This deal should have been closed weeks ago. Tell him to keep tomorrow open . . .

How about his nights? He's too busy running around. Tell him to keep tomorrow night open, come in and sign this thing, or I'll call this whole deal off.

They've been coming in steady all morning. I have called for some extra police.

Yes, sir.

The fools! If they only knew it, they're making things worse for themselves. Somebody starts a silly rumor, and they lose their heads.

Yes, ma'am, you can deposit your money here.

Absolutely.

The ten dollars.

No.

What's the matter, Matt? Gee, I thought you'd be thrilled to death.

Well . . . ?

He was in the bank yesterday.

He came to see Mr. Cluett.

I don't care about the Dooley sisters - what time did he get in?

You're carrying too much money on you, Hank. You better turn some in tonight.

Where's Charlie?

Certainly, Mr. Jones! Certainly! Charlie!

Uhh, yeah it does.

That was because of... the reputation the gang had.

I'm sorry, Cole.

My plan of lying here pissing myself seems to be working mighty fine, thank you.

Corn gonna shoot at me?

Jesus mercy, that's Charlie Higgins, Dave Laller ...

Damn!

But if we take their money and supplies...

What?

Where you boys going?

Because we were good at it?  Hell, we were great at it. Jesse, don't tell anyone I said this, because everybody knows I'm the toughest man in this town, but you are one terrifying sonofabitch with those guns.

The James-Younger Gang.

Beautiful.

A bad idea.

Still smells fishy.

Wait'll we get back to Missouri, start telling those gals about how little Jesse James charged the whole Union Army by himself!

OPEN THE DAMN SAFE!

You 'um big lawman?

Go ahead to the saloon. But don't get too drunk!

Web died fighting?

You know you're welcome any time!

Daddy, don't start with this again.

Well, I hope the boy pulls through. We should know in the morning.

That would have made an impression.

Hell of a war.

Hello, Liberty Missoura!

Whyyyy... he took down the Gatling gun and the cannon all by himself.

That just might work.

You are a charmer.

-- if you stop saying things about my Zee.

And we're good at it.

You've killed your fair share of men.

They're all pinned down. Can't even get to the door.

He was a boy riding with the most famous outlaws in the West. How was he supposed to say no to that?

Saved a lot of folk from the railroad.

Ma, I'm glad to see you being nice to our Injun friend.

Easterners.

Teasing you is completely unfair.

I shouldn't tease a hero.

I was thinking more along the lines of being a river pirate.

Yep.

Are you going to be happy here, Mr. James? Without all that excitement?

Hmm.

I beg your pardon?

Tennessee?

Yes?

Oh. That's nice to know.  We're going to hang you, you know.

Was it worth it?

This is unusual. Most of our marriages are members of the congregation.

You okay, Jesse?

Not too young to shoot a man, not to young to drink.

Jim, you been with a girl yet?

Tell you something else.  I can't drink that good neither. I'm going to go outside and throw up.

Oh, you were talking to Jesse.

Gosh, that's a pretty name. Buy you a drink?

Really!

To be precise, they didn't blow up the tracks.

The final route for the railroad is complete.

What is that?

That.

How did you know?

Look at this, Pinkerton! They got the payroll, and this damage will set construction back two months at least.

You wouldn't have done that?

I want them arrested and hanged!

Pinkerton. It's been eight months. I see robberies. I see hold ups. But I do not see men on the end of nooses.

Every three months, the James Gang circles back to the vicinity of Liberty, Missouri. They always pull a job right before they return, probably to have extra money to give family and friends.

On a lot of lithium?

You should come have dinner with me. COURTNEY But-when?

Uh huh.

I can't.

Pick me up?

Are we here?

No, you idiot. I said "Is it a receptacle tip?" Not, is Luis a despicable twit. Is it a receptacle tip? Get off me.

Pull out.

Pull out, goddamnit!

Oh Jesus. I'm going home.

See? Happy? You dumb bitch? Are you happy, you dumb bitch?

We were supposed to have dinner at Tad and Maura's, but-you know how Luis is...

Isn't that special?  Patrick?

This is nicer than your other apartment.

Your father practically owns the company. You can do anything you like, silly.

He's good-looking.

Are you using minoxidil?

Your hairline looks like it's receding.

You're inhuman.

Are you my two o'clock?

Are you sure?

I think you should go now.

Don't come back.

Jesus, Davis. Yes. That was hilarious. That was you, wasn't it?

It was a pretty long message, wasn't it?

Carnes? Wait.

Now, if you'll excuse me, I really must...

There's this theory out now that if you can catch the AIDS virus through having sex with someone who is infected, then you can also catch anything-Alzheimer's, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, leukemia, diabetes, dyslexia, for Christ's sake-you can get dyslexia from pussy-

It's definitely weak but I have a feeling if we do enough of it we'll be okay.

SHUT UP!

I can't believe that Price prefers McDermott's card to mine.

Raised lettering, pale nimbus white...

Yes, Caron's right. Gorbachev's not downstairs. He's at Tunnel.

I'm leaving. I'm getting out.

Dorsia, yes?

We are totally booked.

Okay, Jean. I need reservations for three at Camols at twelve-thirty, and if not there, try Crayons. All right?

Yes?

What is it?

Who?

Yes, Patrick?

Oh Patrick, I can't make this decision.

You don't need to lose any weight. You're kidding, right? You look great. Very fit.

Patrick? I can't hear you.

Well...

You think I'm dumb, don't you?

Hubert's? Oh really? It moved uptown, right?

Well, what about, oh, you know, maybe a Saturday?

Elizabeth, it's three in the morning.

Don't tell him you're here.

Come on. I think it would be a turn-on.

Well, you went to Sarah Lawrence for one thing.

You're not with the FBI or anything, are you?

Coffee?

Well, what's the topic of discussion?

Where did you go to school?

You sure?

What can you tell me about Paul Owen?

So...there's nothing you can tell me about Paul Owen?

What kind of man was he? Besides...  the information you've just given.

Do you feel that way?

Yeah. You know...hang out.

Anything else you can tell me about Owen?

Actually, yes.

Was he involved at all , do you think, in occultism or Satan worship?

Listen, if anything occurs to you, any information at all...

I mean they want to get caught.

What?

But...everyone orders the hash browns here. I mean- it's-have you been here before?

So, the night he disappeared? Any new thoughts on what you did?

Oh. KIMBALL Now where were you? 

You're not what? Qualified for anything else?

Get a goddamn job, Al. You've got a negative attitude. That's what's stopping you. You've got to get your act together. I'll help you.

Hello, Halberstam. Nice tie. How the hell are you?

How's the Ransom account going, Marcus?

You don't wanna move, do you?

I can't help it. I feel like they'd do anything to keep their --

It's important.

If my dad'd leveled with me like that even once... The weird thing is, my fantasy he could somehow be like the old Gary? It's his fantasy, too.

That took some fun out of --

They hack into people's programs?

It isn't a broadcast studio. It's -- a surveillance post or something. That's why they have the dishes on top.

They stop the construction work at six or seven. The parking lot's mostly clear by two or three in the morning. Even the early Geeks don't get there before five.

The Justice Department guy who came to the apartment when --

That was -- different.

Where were you?  You know you can't keep anything from me.

Great!

...What?

That'll be a test, won't it?

He said it made sense that Gary's code was like Teddy's, that that cliché about great minds was true. Said it was all about his own guilt.  Plus, he has a tendency to get Gary mixed-up with his dad once in a while. It always passes.

Don't worry, Milo. I'm here as a friend. Or maybe a supplicant.

Yes sir. I need to talk to you.

Will I get to work for Outpost?

What?!

You're interfaced with our dish.

Is it your software?

There's no hard evidence he knew about this. Anybody who could implicate him seems to've vanished.

Milo? I'm Danny.

...Hello?

Cool!

Among other things... We know convergence is the real super-highway: all the PC's, TV's, phones, etc. linked together. Why cram it into a cable if you can use the whole sky?

When you get to a certain age, you start wondering. About your legacy. I doubt you even remember Outpost 1.0 --

No! Just waiting for my counselor to come by and introduce himself.

Could work with a new switch. There may be a few more things hidden.

How's it going?

I heard what happened.

You've been coming in early.

Wow. You must have 20,000 lines of code there...

I'm okay. It's going well!

Cause he was a liar. And I hated him.  "Get your head out of that machine, wise up to the real world." The more he mocked me the deeper I went. Cause if being savvy meant being like him --  Guess that's why I'm kind of clueless, even now. Didn't cultivate my conniving side. 'Not sure I even have one.

What'd the girl say?

What?

All the companies know. The faculties tell 'em. At the target schools.

Just thought his work should go on.

It's only meaningful when you've got 40,000 lines of code to back it up.

They just pushed up the schedule on Skywire apps. How fast are you going?

Mine's not the CEO. He barely remembers to take a shower.

I know why you're so secretive. Why you won't let anybody near you.  I know what he did to you.

I always felt if a -- boy I liked ever found out -- he'd run. He'd think I was unclean.

Yeah, they dig stuff like this.  "CBS News has partnered with Outpost Information Systems in a cable news network due to launch Fall of 2001."

You'd have to design a graphic interface to make the data pop. Maybe some audio, too. To tie it all in to Gary. How long would that take you?

I told Teddy about you.

Thank God.

Meet me at the other location.

Is that how Larry feels?

They're in the neighborhood. They usually hassle Vietnamese grocers.

I'm cool. They didn't touch the machine. Or my disks. Probably didn't know what they were. So, you a Moonie yet?  Milo?

What? Come on. Is it serious?

Heavy graphical background, doing design-interface for Skywire apps.  You'll be working with her.

What, and watch all my earnings go...  Down the toilet?

I didn't, baby, you just told me.

May I wash you?

How do you feel, Mr. Cunningham?

Do you mind if I ask you a personal question?

"Fifteen minutes of fame?" I'm going to use that quote and not give you any credit for that, either.

Thank you.

Oh, and Austin...

Yes?

Oh, yes. Thank you.

Yes?

Hello, Exposition.

My God, Austin, what have you done?

But, wait, I-- you got me again. Oh, and Austin--

What's wrong with your hand?

I'm sorry, baby, I'm just not grocking your head space.

I've got you, Dr. Evil!

No, man, what we swingers were rebelling against were uptight squares like you, whose bag was money and world domination. We were innocent, man. If we'd known the consequences of our sexual liberation, we would have done things differently, but the spirit would have remained the same.  It's freedom, man.

My mother's told me all about you.

OK, OK, man, don't get heavy, I'll sign. Just to get things moving, baby.

Have you ever made love to a Chigro?

You know, a Chigro... part Chinese, part Negro...  Chigro.

Listen, Vanessa, I'm a swinger... That's what I do, I swing.

Let me guess. The floss is garotte wire, the toothpaste contains plastic explosives, and the toothbrush is the detonation device.

Unfortunately, while you told that stupid story, Dr. Evil has escaped.

No, did you use a condom?

Out and about, doing odds and sods.

First, I plan to soil myself. Then, I plan to regroup and think about the next move. Any thoughts?

It's a shame he wasn't more headstrong.

I'm not going anywhere. We're a team.

Follow me! We're going to have to jump over the rail!

It says here, name Danger Powers.

Hi, folks. You're entering a restricted zone. Can I see your security badges?

Noooooooooooooo!

Oh my God, he's back.

Shut up.

Well, after a few years, we got sort of impatient. Dr. Evil, I want you to meet your son.

Right.

Really? Are they ill-tempered?

That was great, Mr. Keon, Dave. Thank you. OK, group, we have two new member. Say hello to Scott and his father, Mr.... Ehville?

Actually, the boy's quite astute. I am trying to kill him. My Evil Associates have cautioned against it, so here he is, unfortunately, alive.

But Scott, who's going to take over the world when I die?

Scott my boy, come here. How was your day?

I have a better idea. I'm going to put him in an easily-escapable situation involving an overly- elaborate and exotic death.

Don't you think we should ask for more than a million dollars? A million dollars isn't that much money these days.

I just don't see it.

Did you ever...

No, it's been too long. Best to leave things alone.

We don't label people here, Scott.

Really?

Normally, we'd be eager to oblige --

Knight ...

... death ...

Fear ...

He said if it vanished, he'd know it was ... you who betrayed him. He took a huge risk. The ultimate test.

I so agree. How did you acquire a taste for it?

May I help you, madam ...

Sir August ... ? Sir August ... ?

Congratulations, Mrs. Peel. You have been a worthy opponent. You have tracked us down. You are within an ace of winning.

Father will be your controller. Steed here will show you the ropes.

That's better. I say, isn't this where you came in? It's impenetrable, by the way ...

My father always wanted a boy.

Steed, we really must be --

I have no choice. Why should you risk your life?

According to Mother, Sir August owns half of the Highlands. A millionaire. Former head of Special Projects at the Ministry. Now ...

For you, Mrs. Peel.

The Prospero Project was started by my husband. It was an early attempt to solve the problems of global warming. In theory, climate engineering is entirely feasible. We thought of injecting a chemical cocktail into the atmosphere by laser and satellite. A 'quick fix'...

Not that I know of.  Explanation?

Do you always drive this fast?

What, Lady Disdain? Are you yet breathing?

To kill me?

I'm playing to win.

What's that you're wearing?

Laying in supplies, Mrs. Peel weather may get very nasty and I've no umbrella ...

No bother. Mother and Father think I've joined you. I might as well.

Mrs. Peel?

'The owl and the pussycat went to sea -'

Our chaperon.

Think of it as special assignment, Mrs. Peel. With a twist. You're our chief suspect.

Emma in Wonderland. Welcome, Mrs. Peel.  We've been expecting you. We hope you'll enjoy your stay with us. Decontamination is almost complete.

Talk to the pipe, Mrs. Peel. That usually helps. Don't worry about me being invisible. Other than that I'm perfectly normal.

Under the circumstances Mother didn't see fit, but I think I can get you in ...

You're not venturing alone, surely.

A series of bizarre shifts in local weather patterns ...

We know one thing. That suspect was not Mrs. Peel.

Mother. I thought you were burglars.

Weather's turning nasty.

Insane ... ?

We had a lead to Wonderland Weather but we got there too late. Someone tipped them off ...

You're accusing Mrs. Peel of killing her own husband?

Pity. I was growing fond of Mrs. Peel. Unfortunately --

One shot -- for emergencies.

I don't get it, but at least Gary's got the real stuff coming up here in a few minutes.

Seventy-five hundred.

I'm ready to make you another deal.

Rick... Debbie is mine. She'll always be.

So, Cole, you been practicing your game?

It's not her mind you need to change. It's Disneyland head in there.

Some fat slob in the next booth is making a lot of noise.

Cole, we've got to talk.

You know how that makes me feel, Deb? Wanta know how that makes me feel?  Angry, Deb.  Yesss, that's the word, angry. But if he makes you happy, you go right ahead. I want you to be happy, Deb.  No matter what, no matter how angry it makes me, no matter how much it hurts. Be happy, Deb. Be oh, so very, very happy.

God, you're a slob.

Don't worry... it's supposed to do this.

No, sweetheart, it's a stag party. Does stay home.

Well... twenty-four more hours to go and tonight we'll share with our friends and loved ones the joys of those last moments of singleness.

Have a good time. Don't make it too late.

I don't believe you.

Great. Now, what do you want to do about it?

Ilene, are you crazy?

What kind of job? I'm a housewife.

So we want your best girls, the cream of your crop.

Okay... We're all here. Rick, what's the big announcement?

Gary, how we doing, big stallion?

I'm telling you I am, Joe.

Big problem now. Soon they go to customers.

I hate her. I hate her guts, the bitch.

Is that all the coke in the place?

You okay?

Hi, guys. We brought back a friend.

Are any of those right?

Keep your voices down. This is a respectable establishment. We don't go for any funny business here. Just then a GUY with a Moosehead Beer hat and TWO GUYS in a moose costume pass him and enter the elevator with the boys.

You're all under arrest. Open up!

Mr. Thomerson, I...

Feel free.

The end.

Ed... you're kinky!

How are we doing? My name is O'Neill. And you are...?

Mrs.?

Where'd she go?

What's the matter?

Excuse me, but this is as arousing as a stroll through the Vatican.

I think you'll enjoy this table.

Rick, I'm concerned.

This is your bachelor party. You haven't had sex with anyone yet.

How about this, a Trojan donkey.

Well, the first month it's great. The second month things calm down a little. By the third month you're looking through your old girlfriends' phone numbers; by the fourth month you're numb; by the fifth month, hopefully the football season starts.

There can be no excuse for tardiness.

Sister, do you ever get lonely after vespers? If you do, why don't you give me a call. I'm in the book.

How the hell are we supposed to get this donkey inside?

Wash it to the windows?

It's gonna flash, Stevie. We gotta get behind it.

Aw man, Stephen, listen to me...

Did you do it for Tim?

In the Field Museum once.

There's only so much technology can do.  Thanks for the beer.

Ya love it, probie?

Y'know, you got an awful short memory for direct orders. I told you to stay beside me.

Goddamn it Stephen!

Jesus, it's too damn bright in here... Like a goddamn spotlight... I'm goin' blind...

That's not what it's about, Brian. The point is there was a kid in there. And what if there'd been two? I went in because that's what I do. It's my way. It's dad's way. It isn't everybody's way.

Brian, look --

Look, I'm not the same girl who had nothing better to do than wrap her legs around you on a Saturday night. This isn't about fun. I'm working here.

I've been thinking about what you said the other night... If the offer's still on the table, I'd like to talk about it.

Boss and I are up to about three words an hour.

Okay.

Thanks for the invite.

This is one of the oldest fire stations in the city. Lotta tradition locked up in here. What do you think?

Well, our specimen here is your basic standard issue piece of primary suppression equipment. This area is the pumping panel, which controls the rate of liquid insertion into the hose.

I didn't know it was a secret. There aren't supposed to be secrets between the city and its investigators --

Let me ask you something, do you really think Marty had you assigned to arson because of your firefighting skills? Who the hell are you kidding? I was there, remember? I saw you and your brother --

Hi.

I'll see ya around, huh?

I'm close... but I can't get who it is...

Famous story even. Straight burn. Just an engine and truck first on scene. What did you feel, Brian, when you first got there?

Right. Light smoke, low roll. Couple'a civilians hollering -- medium deal. So young fireman Adcox and Captain McCaffrey, they head up stairs, get out on the fire escape -- McCaffrey does the ballsy jump across... what were you feeling, Brian?  C'mon, you promised. Be honest.  Okay... Guard!

Very good, Brian. -- About your report here. The way to a torch's heart is through his tools. That's how you know him. It's the way he talks to the fire. And to you if you listen.

Oh Jesus Christ...

If it was a joke, sir, you'd be laughing.

If you remember, sir, my test scores were in the top --

No, it isn't out of your hands or you wouldn't even have met me. If I push you have to let me back in. Dead Hero Father Rule. Sir.

Where are you going?

Why backdrafts. Whoever fried Seagrave and Cosgrove went to a helluva lot of trouble to make sure they died by fire, but also made sure the fire blew itself out.

In a word, Brian, what is this job all about?

Nice bunch of guys.

Then who wrote the report?

'Bout written you off. How long have you been in town?

Sean, come on out, man. What, you forget your favorite uncle?

Well that's two things to strangle Stephen for. Where is he, anyway?

Every little boy's fantasy.

Yeah, we got all kinds of traditions -- like dying young.

Your brother's right. If you don't fasten these correctly they could open and you'd get burned.

Yeah... I just thought I should say, I don't know, something.

You want some coffee?

I know he's out, but how's he doing?

Sure Ronald? You're ready alright.

-- Burn them.

Got a cause?

...He wasn't listening to the right thing...

It knows us. This one knows us.

Don't you have any leads at all?

I'm gonna need some bread, man. This ain't fair. I'm always here for you, and you can't even take decent care of me. My landlord is bitching like a motherfucker! You're two months behind on the rent, Lieutenant!

You brought it back to the Church. And then it made it's way back to me, again.

That stuff'll kill you quick, man.

I forgive you.

It's still my money. If you want to have a chance at any part of it, shithead, you will take my $120,000 and bet on tomorrow's game.

I got them all going for Oakland. With bullshit money. We'll cover the $800.

Fuck Strawberry. You're gonna end up owing 60 G to a homicidal maniac!

Get this, man. I was at the game today. Face to fucking face with Strawberry! Jesus! I saw him strikeout. And you know what? He looked at me, and I looked at him, and he laughed and I laughed and it was like we were all alone in that whole stadium and only we understood that it was all a racket, that he struck out on purpose, and that he's saving it up for the Big One. Tomorrow. Today I understood for the very first time that --

I also thought of that bread, Father. And of that night six days ago when the Mother Superior died, and I kept the cool, damp cloth on her forehead freshly moist. Father, what would you do if you had but one day in which to use your legs to serve God?

You truly are a dancing fool.

C'mon.  It's easy.  It's the same thing y'all do out at the Yankee game, no different 'cept we changing one word.  Everybody go it?

Well you did.

My group we need some exposure. Was wondering if you could hook a brother up?

We're ready when you are.

Our first caller is Big Black from Brooklyn.  Go 'head.

Certified ladies' man, huh?

Please, have a seat.

Jim Jones, y'know.  I'm not drinking the Kool-Aid.

I'm out.

Chill, I'm the brains behind this outfit.

What do I have to do?

I'm sorry about my blowup but I have to have a whipping boy every meeting.

Delacroix, wake up, brother man. The reason why they didn't get picked up was because nobody - and I mean NOBODY - niggers and crackers alike wants to see that junk.

You got your head stuck up your ass with your Harvard education and your pretentious ways.  Brother man, I'm blacker than you.  I'm keepin' it real and you're frontin', trying to be white.

I've done a lot of soul searching and once again you are right.  In my previous work it's been all surface, superficial.  I have never really dug deep.  Not anymore.  As Mark Twain fully understood satire is the way.  Race has always been a hot button in this country's history and it needs to be pushed harder.  If we are ever to live side by side in peace and harmony. It's about promoting racial healing.

Word!!!

Every week we follow the trials and tribulations of two real coons - Mantan and Sleep 'n Eat.  The Dusky Duo.

We gonna hit 'em wid da BOMB DICKEY on dis' one.  What's the setting?

I strongly feel that a Negro should direct this.  This kind of satire is a high wire act in a gale storm. One misstep and we're doing "Amos and Andy."  Only a Negro will have the sensitivity and cultural awareness to navigate this dangerous terrain.

That's exactly my point.  Has he even directed actors before in anything?

Purely for medicinal purposes.

Enough about me, what's happening with you?

Three nights Charleston, South Carolina.

So what's up with you?

Manray!

You lost me.

You okay?

Even if money wasn't an issue, Dunwitty will still go ahead without me and that could be more dangerous.

Good morning, for those of you who don't know me, I'm Pierre Delacroix. I'm running things and this here is my assistant Sloan Hopkins.

Just want to say good luck.

Your life will never be the same.

Same here.

Who's side are you on?

What would their reaction be?  I hadn't the foggiest.

The Jolly Nigger Bank.

How so?

DeLa, you should try it sometime. Come into the light.

That which has been hidden in darkness is now in the light.  This bucket of blood.

I told you but you wouldn't listen. You never listened to me.

Yes, your name?

This is nothing.  It will blow over by tomorrow.

No joke.  Serious.

You shouldn't even be mad at me over Sloan.

Peerless, your father called.

He's performing at some place outside of Richmond, Virginia.

Even more reason to see him.  He'll be overjoyed with your success.

Of course I'm happy for you. You've worked very hard for your success.

You know how your Daddy is.

A fiasco.  A disaster.  A boondoggle. An abomination.

How did you get this gig?

Yes you!

I never had a really real pair before.

So what's up with you and DeLa?

No, we're not knocking boots.  I got this internship while I still was at NYU, DeLa was impressed with my get up and go and hired me to be his assistant.

Why do you say that?  You've never seen me.

Let's jump right into it.  Your show has sparked a world of controversy, provoked a tone of dialogue.  How do you see all of this?

Is it inevitable that the game plays you?

We both left the hustle and bustle of Uptown, Harlem...

To come back to our roots.

Y'know my lady Lucindy?

No, not that.  How 'bout...

Mantan, way too short, too tight. Get her one of dose...

...aconite get it dat cheap.

I heard ya lady is wild.

Oh, because on our first date, she let me...

A lot?

I hope you save a little somethin' somethin'.

Why don't you call him?

You're sure this is a good idea.

You leave something out?

Stop playing me Sloan.

Aw, c'mon.

So you say.  Sloan, you wuz gonna use me up just like you used Dela? Work it to the top.  I never imagined people in this biz could flip on you like "IHOP."  I'm damn happy DeLa fired ya ass.

Where are you bound for?

Both of us ride home with Best here.

Well, well!  What is it?  We'll make you used to our ways, or adopt English ones.

Pooh!  Pooh!  Best, you are joking.

Sir, I'm a British officer.

This is a pretty way to recommend yourself to the family.

Well, if it must be, it must.  For a young fellow, you are the most bloodthirsty I ever saw.  No officer, bearing His Majesty's commission, can receive a glass of wine on his nose, without resenting it -- fight you must, and Best is a huge, strong fellow.

My mare is saddled and ready; who's the captain's second?

She took on so at your going away that she was obliged to console herself with a husband.  She is now Mrs. John Best.

No, the very same one, my boy.  He recovered from his wound.  The ball you hit him with was not likely to hurt him.  It was only made of tow. Do you think the Dugans would let you kill fifteen hundred a-year out of the family?  The plan of the duel was all arranged in order to get you out of the way, for the cowardly Englishman could never be brought to marry from fear of you.  But hit him you certainly did, Roderick, and with a fine thick plugget of tow, and the fellow was so frightened that he was an hour in coming to. We told your mother the story afterwards, and a pretty scene she made.

Oh, I am thinking of the O'Higgins of Redmondstown.  General O'Higgins was a close friend of my wife's dear father, Colonel Granby Somerset.

I don't know.

Ten thousand?  But the scoundrel owes me seventy thousand.

Who else can give me information about you?

Not even that.

Many worthy of attention; but valuing is something more.  I could value only someone whom I loved.

And if she does not choose to show you some kindness?

Suppose, now, Roderick, you, who are such a hero, was passing over the bridge and the enemy on the other side.

What, with me on the pillion?  Would you kill poor me?

Monster!  Your father was a tailor, and you are always thinking of the shop.  But I'll have my revenge, I will!  Roddy, will you see me insulted?

And, to be sure, I did know someone who knew precisely how these things were done, and this was the distinguished solicitor and former Government Minister, Lord West, whose acquaintance I made, as I had so many others, at the gaming table.

The King has determined to send the Chevalier out of the country.

Then this must be done tomorrow.

Be off to your work, you pack of rascals, or you will have a good taste of my thong.  Have you lost much?

Mister Bracegirdle said to me that he had heard her ladyship lives in some fear of her life, and meditated a separation, in which case, she might later repudiate any documents signed by herself while in durance, and subject them, at any rate, to a doubtful and expensive litigation. They were quite insistent on this point, and said they must have absolute assurance of her ladyship's perfect freewill in the transaction before they would advance a shilling of their capital.

Papa?

One of the boys in the stable told Nelly that you've already bought my horse, and that it's at Doolan's farm, where Mick the groom is breaking it in.  Is that true, papa?

Indeed, you are right, sir.  Look at me.  Marriage has added forty years to my life.  I am dying, a worn-out cripple, at the age of fifty.  When I took off Lady Cosgrove, there was no man of my years who looked so young as myself.  Fool that I was! I had enough with my pensions, perfect freedom, the best society in Europe -- and I gave up all these, and married and was miserable.  Take a warning from me, Mr. Roderick, and stick to the trumps.  Do anything, but marry.

Charming Schuvaloff.

Don't like 'em, don't eat 'em, don't make no damn difference to me.

Fuck, what the fuck is going on --

What about you, wandering around alone? At least we have an alibi --

Holy fuck... Holy fuck, what the fuck did you guys do?

You too?

I don't know... I like the Army.

You did Basic here?

There's no need...

Why'd you ask for a cop, Ray?

I apologize --

Are you saying Sergeant West tried to kill you?

That first night with Pike. I made the mistake of letting him sit down at around 0300.

You know how to work a pistol, Dunbar?

Shut up.  Let me see your grenades.

Jesus, what happened?

Pike and I got separated... then I heard gunfire. Close.

Right?

Mueller.

Full clip to the body --

Way I figure it, West must have found out about their little business and was gonna bust them, so they decided to get rid of him first...

A test will no doubt link you to the killing --

You... I've seen you around the Base. But you...  You're not Army, are you?

That's it. You're that policeman with friends in low places. Tell me, how's Guissepe Torres doing these days? Those racketeering indictments must have really been a downer --

Levi, I don't know if you're familiar with investigative work, but we have this little thing called "motive" and you just gave yourself one.

What happened to "degrees"?

Okay. I think that's it. He rises and walks to the door.

Why did you tell us he shot everybody, Levi? You put him in for three murders, the man saved your life --

Dunbar will testify that you were.

Where are they!

MAYBE WHAT --

That bad?

The official term for it is "Clusterfuck". By the time Beth hit us, I'd canceled all off base exercises save one -- a six man cadet team and their Drill out in the bush. We're missing three and the Sergeant. The cadets are in their eighth week of the cycle, nobody here knows much about them, up to and including their names. But the Sergeant...

A few years ago, the Army picked our good buddy as their go to non-com to trot out to the press to talk about the kinder, gentler military. He even did the standard video greeting played to all incoming Basic cadets across the country.

They're taking your command, aren't they?

Levi? Who names their kid Levi --

Christ... Remind me to thank Bill for mentioning that on the phone --

Because interrogation rooms look suspiciously like interrogation rooms, which doesn't exactly put people at ease. Is he cute?

Is Dunbar cute?

Thank you. At some point in there I'm gonna rub my nose. When I do, go at him with everything you got.

I questioned him for three hours and he didn't make a sound. You don't have a badge, he won't talk to you.

Typical army brat story. Dad was noncom, Mom was a Nurse. There was never any real doubt of joining up.

You're kidding.

This is the straight hitting on me you were talking about, isn't it?

You're off to a late start.

You guys really got the shit kicked out of you here.

I was starting to believe you, you know? That you weren't who everyone said. I guess I was wrong --

Dunbar.

So it's a good plan but it goes wrong; Mueller flips out and shoots their fall guy, which means they have to bring Dunbar and Kendall into the cover story --

Go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened.

The thing is, we've got a real opportunity here. You turn me in tomorrow and we're both fucked --

They found him. Poor fucker was practically blown in half --

We just want --

He couldn't kick you out so he wanted you to quit on your own.

But you didn't see it, right?

Pike never confessed.

Dunbar says you were.

Thank God...

Sign here and here.  Hey, ain't you the folks workin' on that whole hulabaloo from last night?

So?

He's not Army, it's not official --

You want Kendall, don't you?

Some of you may have heard there's a hurricane coming! American soldiers do not wait for good weather -- they do not wait for a bright sunshiney day to do their duty! An American Soldier learns to operate in the worst conditions and turn said conditions into an advantage against their enemy! Anyone who thinks these conditions are too harsh, feel free to lay down and die, you get me?

Tough break. Most men have to get married before they lose their wives.

I don't have a job, but I would have a job if you gave me one. And I may not have much, but I have more determination than any man you're ever going to meet.

You were expecting me?

The poet? What ever happened to him?

Or are you too scared?

What the hell are you doing? This is my girl. Mine!

Will.

I'm eight. That means when I'm eighteen, you'll be 28. And when I'm 28, you'll only be 38.

You must be Edward Bloom.

In so many words, yes.

You're Beamen's daughter. Your last name is different.  You married.

It's okay, just leave it.

Lord, I'm sorry I...

Hi. How are you feeling?

Will never told you that?  Probably just as well. He would have told it all wrong anyway. All the facts and none of the flavor.

Hardly two stories in the whole place. Now I've heard in real cities, they've got buildings so tall you can't even see the tops of 'em.

You're just trying to get me to leave, aren't you? That's why they sent you here.

What did she say?

What, a father's not allowed to talk about his son?

The one about the witch.

Having a kid changes everything. I mean, there's the diapers and the burping and the midnight feedings...

Truly. I saw it in The Eye.

I saw my death in that eye. And this is not how it happens.

You owe me three-fifty.

I can try, Dad. If you help. Just tell me how it starts.

You become what you always were. A very big fish.  And that's the way it happens.

You don't even know me.

How can I convince you to stop?

Wait! I need those!

This is why you don't show work in progress.

I can't imagine any place better than here.

It's me. Norther Winslow.

Oh. Oh.

Can I ask you a question? Why did you come here today? If you found this deed, why didn't you just ask Eddie?

I'm going with you.

I talked with your father last night.

You never told me how your parents met.

You have to understand. When I was growing up, he was gone more than he was here. And I started thinking -- maybe he has a second life somewhere else. With another house, another family. He leaves us, he goes to them. Or maybe there is no family. Maybe he never wanted a family. But whatever it is, maybe he likes that second life better. And the reason he tells all those stories is because he can't stand this boring place.

Look, I know why you like him. I know why everyone likes him. But I need you to tell me I'm not crazy.

I know it's not easy. Just remember, he didn't choose to be your father and you didn't choose to be his son. You just ended up together. You could pick numbers out of a dark bag and it'd be just the same. If you ask me, it's a wonder parents and children can stand each other at all.

You know what for.

I got you those trousers from Paul Smith.

When we went to the Hard Rock Cafe. Who paid? When we went to see 'Cats'. Who paid?

Yeah it was okay.

What?

This is sensitive. Your car. Lovely car. Doesn't necessarily give the right impression.

You can see why it's sensitive?

How's that? We can't drink our piss can we?

Yes. I know.

So hang on. You're both Nadia's cousins?

Binoculars.

I have brought you trouble. Maybe I should have come alone.

He says you scare him so much he must go to the toilet in his trousers. John, he is a soldier. A trained killer. We must do what he says.

He wants the money from your bank.

You don't understand. He wants all the money that is in your bank.

Is that everything?

I bet.  What about me? Am I how you imagined?

You must think... I'm the biggest pillock... In the world.

I do. I want to very badly.

Fine.

So uh...

Oh Jesus.

Excuse me?

Yeah. I tend to tie up and abandon women I really want to see again too.

Shut up. I'm not listening.

I think it's my safest bet, don't you?

Excuse me?

You are throwing me out.

You know, in Russia, there's no work for women. It's a different world.

Fifteen. You don't know him. He was very kind and strong.

I don't have nothing.

Do you know if it's a boy or a girl?

What happened between you and the blonde?

Something else.

Whatever.

Thank you.  Oh. My wife. She had a card here for her migraine pills. She ain't gonna be around no more... So if you...

Just wanted to say how much I appreciate you helping me the other day. My niece, she's cured up, and I got you to thank.

What do you need?

Laz. I'm gonna put my trust in you. I'm gonna do it knowin' all too well I can get hurt like this. And I have been hurt. Just like you.  Woman like me, I got a lot of livin' to do. But my days are precious to me. They all I got left. Don't want no more fuss. I want love in my life. You understanding me, Laz?

Folks can dance when they want. Didn't buy that mirror ball for nothin'.

Cuz let me tell you, you boys gotta run the ball more. You get into a kicking game, ya'll gonna lose.

Still need a lift?

And then you had to fall in love with the school slut.

It's not like I can't go out and have fun with my friends.

Ronnie ship out this mornin'?

Nothing's gonna happen. Not like everybody over there is in the line of fire with them Arabs blowin' themselves up.

Can't remember the last time I saw you in that suit.

We leavin' this weekend. Deke got a friend in Mobile gonna get him a job at the water company...

I'm not ready to grow old, Laz. Livin' with you. I feel it. Like I'm one foot in the dirt. Saw it happen to my momma. And that's not gonna happen to me. I got living to do.

God forgive you, for how you done me...

Or what? OR WHAT?

Teh... Tehronne?

Nn-nn... Nn-nn... no... N'RONNIE!

Mm-mm... Mm-mm...

Let me say somethin' first...

I give ya enough chain so's you can get about the house. Get you to the kitchen. You need the bathroom, it'll reach.

You some kind'a pervert?

Now you get up! And you get in my house!

I said... STOP!

My Daddy was one of the first mens to organize soil conservation in these parts. That's a group of farmers, you know, each season they'd rotate the crop. Know why it's best to rotate em like that?

Good. Now I got the steaks on, potatoes at a boil, and biscuits ready to pop in the oven. R.L. and Lincoln out yonder grillin' up the corn. What do you know how to make?

They sure liked them devilled eggs.

I seen a man die. He couldn't breathe... his heart was... was givin' out.

Where you gonna be?

How you feelin' today?

Stop that foolishness. Just do as I say and close your eyes.  Close your eyes. And think about... well, for a song like this, I'd say you think about what you love.

I don't pimp that.  You talkin' about who I think you talkin' about, you mean Rae. Rae Doole. Sexy little split tail, like you say. I can't hook you up with that. I got two girls. One ain't in town, the other one pregnant. So... you on your own.

Shit. Who hasn't?

She got a spare minute she'll snatch up anyone... but me, I'm different. Sometimes she need the real deal, so she call me up. Girl got an itch. You know... what's a nigga to do?

Like I say, you wanna hook that up... I ain't in ya way. That switch of hers been all over this town. Got that sickness, you know.

I think you did alright by God under the circumstances.  Your people are here for you, Laz. This is your home. No shame in showing your face.

A naked woman, chained in ya house?

Mm. MM. Now these eggs got some kick to it. What'chu got in this?

Heard about this morning.

Thank you.

Can I ask you a question?  People always say, you gotta get good with Jesus, if you want not to go to hell. That you say sorry for all you done and... and Jesus would let you go on to heaven.

Well. That's my vomit. I came in here to get sick. I thought I'd make the toilet but... anyway, I got sick.

I feel better. Do you?

What happened to your face?

No. That's not why...  Why we always gotta do this? I mean, you and me been at each other as far back as I can remember. Wasn't no love between us. And I'm your daughter. I'm the only family you got.

Wait up.  You know the guy who did the Weismuller through the window --

Who do you think the Jap is?

What are you doing?

Let's go.

Squid?

Joyce can be nice.

Short shift?

Are you expecting anyone?

It may be too soon to talk about it. When someone we care for dies we...  ... keep something of their's.  A tie, a pen.

How'd you get this?

What's he saying?

Did I say that?

Broiled fish paste cake, Kelp roll, soybean curd, devils tongue --

She disappeared... shit!

No...

What's that for?

You all right?

Louder, pal, louder.

Dead gaiijin's are big news.

An outside person.  A foreigner.  A barbarian.  You, me.  More you.

She ever pull down her shades?

My Japanese isn't that hot... Besides, you'll never get in.

'Nam oyo ranged kyo.'  You think it's dumb of course.

They want your autograph.

You'll get Ich killed.

Can't make you change your mind?

I like your friend, Joyce.  You're lucky.

You lost a man we wanted for some time.  It was very incompetent on your part, officer.

I want a gun.

Hey...!  HEY, I'M TALKING TO YOU, INSPECTOR!

Yeah.  It might be better if we talk in private, Sebastian.  Why don't you go home.

I'm surprised you didn't come to me sooner.

And what can he do for you?

What's the problem?

How about breakfast, I was just going to make some.

Show me something?

What about your friend, the man who owns this building?

You're our best and only friend.

I think, therefore I am.

I want to do it.

Industrial refuse.

I was just about to have my dinner.

She was gonna get away.

Look, go home.  Get some rest. Take an aspirin.

Yeah.

Here's something you might find interesting.  They have been built to emulate the human in every way except in its emotional spectrum. However, after a period of time it is only logical that such a 'mechanism' would create its own emotional responses, hate, love, fear, anger, envy.

What about a summary then.

Four years.  Which would make her termination date...

Okay, gimme a run-down on the three females.

Next.

Number three.

How old am I?

My birthday is April 10, 2015. How long do I live?

From what I hear you're doing great.  Bryant tells me you're going like a god damn one-man army.  Making a lot of money, huh?

Let's hear it.

Your mind kept wandering.  That bothered me.

Considering the nature of your work, that could be unhealthy.

What if you change your mind?

You sure?

Why didn't you go?

Who?

I didn't know if I wanted to handle her -- I already got a snake act.  But my partner goes down there to the Opera House on suck night to book the good ones.

Are you for real?

It that mother real?

You'd be surprised what a guy'll go through to get a glimpse of a beautiful body.

I'd take him to the doctor.

You become pregnant by a man who runs off with your best friend, and you decide to get an abortion.

Why not?

Last question.  You're watching an old movie.  It shows a banquet in progress, the guests are enjoying raw oysters.

I can imagine.

I told you I'd come back.

Do you dream?

Nobody is freer than when he dreams.  I read that.

But then how can you...

Don't leave here.  Don't open the door, don't answer the phone.

Thanks.

But in your profession that is a risk.

And how is it one man will be able to cover so much ground?

Let's keep our eyes on the road, Deckard.

We're going to have to start the sequence again if you don't stay with me, Deckard.  Concentrate.

Already had I.Q. test this year -- but I don't think I never had a...

Same thing.

But I understand what you mean.

Mine's J.F. Sebastian.

I'm hungry, J.F.

You look... better.

Beautiful.

Oh, now, that's a great one!

You're kidding!

Eve, I don't mean to be rude, and please excuse me Cliff, but Eve, isn't Cliff just a butt with hair?

No.  I'm from out of town.  I'm here on business.

Get out of here!

What's wrong with you?

Well, I guess because I'm a little psychic...I have this thing.

Yes! Yes! The Holiday Inn! That's exactly right!

Nope.

How's that?

Hey, what are you doing?!

That was...wonderful!  I've never felt anything like that in my life.

What?

Two weeks.

What's fair?

You got it! Wait here while I change.

Why not buy them milk or something-- instead of Dr. Pepper?

I guess we'll need another locker.

Adam?  Don't even think about it. Okay? I'm sorry.  I know that sounds mean, but believe me, it would be meaner if I didn't say it. Okay?

This is for me.

Bites what?

It didn't used to be that way.

When do you need her by?

Never drive again!

Yes!

Why, thank you!  Very nice to have met you, Cliff!  May I ask you a question?

Okay, let's see...I'm not promising anything. You okay?

In the house?

Yeah.  Could be.  Go say hello, Romeo. Looks like a healthy non-mutant to me.

Adam?!

I don't blame you!

I'm really sorry!

I know first aid!

Adam....you should go with Dr. Aron. It's the best thing.  The best thing for you. I promise.

...I do.

How do I leave here?

Like a painting?

Oh, boy! A jacket!

C'est bon, Monsieur.

This must be very new.

The recovery is very impressive.

I'm sorry. I took the Lord's name in vain again, didn't I?  I'm so sorry.

Okay, Troy!  Let's get those all-beef frozen patties!

You bet!

What?

Good-bye, Adam.

Bye, Troy!

How old are you?

Whatcha looking at?

See, my problem is, all I have are hundred dollar bills and I need something smaller.  Ones, fives, tens. Like that.

Oh, that would be wonderful!

Sir? I would really appreciate it if you wouldn't take the Lord's name in vain again.

I'm afraid you've got to.

Mom?  Eve and I have to go.

You know, I don't think so. I'm confused but you know, I don't think he'd ever hurt me. I don't think he'd hurt anyone.

Yes, I can tell that just looking around.  "Boy?"  Did you say you were a "country boy?"

Really?

I'm sorry everyone, but given this extraordinary turn of events, I think it's prudent that we cut the evening short. I'm sure this Cuban thing will resolve itself, but in the meantime...I'd suggest taking a prayerful watch-and-wait stance!

Cheese is particularly troublesome.

Days??

Home sweet home!

Hot Dr. Pepper! Your favorite!

You have tranquilizers?

Oh, no.

No.  I think it's just right.

We looked all over for you. What are you doing back here?

They've done a lot of re-building but society, at least as we knew it, has utterly collapsed. People throw up in the streets. Others point guns. There's something terribly wrong with the automobiles and...and I...I can't tell you the rest.  I just can't.

For how long?  We've just about run out of everything!

How long will you set it for this time?

Go home, Cliff, wherever that might be.

Since that guy rear-ended me in Palm Springs.

Give me your hand.

But first, you have to start with the clothes!

I don't know.

Well, I'm trying to educate him!  It's nothing personal.

Um... Eve?

Hey, you're the psychic. Eve, the psychic pimp.  You tell me.

Where did he get all that information?

Well...I admit it. I'm glad to hear that.

Well what was I supposed to do?! He wants me to live underground with him! That's like Silence of the Lambs, don't you think?!

Gay.

Good God...you don't think there really is a bomb shelter, do you?

What's wrong?

Tower. Wolf One. I've got a problem here.

I don't want to talk about it. Everything's okay now. I don't want to talk about it.

Jeffrey?

I guess you've seen some bad things.

Okay, come on in. Looks like you had a bad face lift.

Okay?

And that man came out with a third man - this well-dressed guy. Here's the photo. I think a girl named Dorothy Vallens is in trouble with these people. I think Frank has taken her husband and her son.

For now. Alright, you better be. And Sandy better not be involved with this, I can tell you. Be prepared to come in for further interrogation on this later.

GET OUT OF THERE!!! GET OUT!!! Put your hands up, on your head. GO ON!!! Get down on your knees - DO IT!! What are you doing? Who are you? What's your name? WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

Shit. You better tell me something.

How'd you like it if someone sneaked into your house and watched you.  Get undressed. I want to see you.

NO, you come on. Take off your pants. I want to see you.

What do you want from me?

Yes.

I made it go down the toilet.

Please don't talk like that. You're upset. I'm not helping you. I'm sorry for what I did. I better go.

Oh shit.

No. But you're in very big trouble.

Yes.

Do you like my body?

Are you a bad boy?

Shut up.

I asked first.

You what?

You called me Jeffrey.

I guess I should go.

HELP HIM!! Promise me you'll help him!

Frank?

Can I feel 'em?

You seemed to see some very interesting things on your little escapade with Dorothy Vallens.

Hello?

No thanks.

Hey? You like to walk.

Raymond! Where's the fuckin' beer?

No, I want ya to fuck it. Shit, yes, pour the fuckin' beer.

Where's all your things, Jeffrey?

Jeffrey, breakfast is ready.

Can I use the car tonight?

God, you scared me.

Well.

No, you're right.

Oh yeah?

How is Central these days?

Did they find out anything when they questioned her?

You said it was a strange world. And you're the strangest part of it. Are you crazy? She is possibly involved in murder. This gives me the creeps.

Thanks. Dorothy Vallens. Okay, goodluck. Three minutes, no sooner.

No. I only saw his back. He went down another stairwell at the end of the hall.

Yes. I do.

That sounds good.

Here's to. An interesting experience.

I wish you wouldn't do this. It doesn't make any sense. Let's go somewhere and have some coffee.

Okay, yeah, call.

I'm sorry, I didn't...

I don't know. I had a dream. In fact, the night I met you.  In the dream the world was dark because there weren't any robins. You know, birds. Robins stood for love, and all of a sudden thousands of robins flew down and brought this blinding light of love. And it felt like that love would be the only thing that would make any difference. I guess, until the robins come there is trouble.

So are you.  I mean you're a neat guy. We better get back.

No, silly - I'm still in school you know. But I'll meet you after school and you can tell me what you've learned. You better be careful, Jeffrey.

Jeffrey? Why?

What was that all about?

It's okay.

Really?

NO.

You want to dance?

My father has a gun at home.

Sandy?

Mike's gotta go.  Nice to meet you.

Sandy? Could I talk to you a minute?

Fuck you.

Listen kid, I think you better understand who you're dealing with here.

There's ways around that.

Lord's name.

Ah, Agent Smecker, we have a problem.

Oh, God! Don't kill me! We're on the same side! The boss musta sent you in as back up, huh? Oh, shit, please! I'm Rocco. I'm the funny man.  They call me the funny fuckin' man!

Chest pocket.  Shit!

Don't you think that's a little psycho? A little weird?

Pack your shit! We gotta get outta here! We gotta get out!

Yeah, well...

I guess we really don't have a system of deciding who.

What the fuck are you doing?

Shit.

Mother, is that you?

I finally found your Da's army revolver, Connor.

So, how is it that you guys are fluent in Russian?

Well, we could try the bag over the head thing. Walk you right out the front.

I think it's better if we find this man before he finds us again.

What are you going to do?

Hold this shit for us, Doc. We'll be comin back for it when we get out.

I do believe the Monsignor finally got a point.

All right, love ya ma. Listen, before ya go just give us the goods, eh?

"What do we tell him about the guns and money?"

Nervous?

Nine bodies.

Mafiosos getting caught with 20 kilos and walkin' on bail the same day.

Now, you will receive us.

We do not want your tired and sick.

They were wearing masks.

The shooter knew these guys, huh?

And the pennies?

That's a possibility. Y'know you Boston cops are perking up. That's two sound theories in one day, neither of which deal with abnormally sized men.  Another possibility is that they were placed there with religious intent.

Allow me to enlighten you gentlemen to the protocol of the porno industry, as I'm sure you've never been in one of these places before. A man goes into the booth, puts the money in the slot. The dancer gets it on the other side. She hits the button, door goes up, now there is only glass between you and it's  little fireman time.

Who the...

A couple of peons for the mob and...

What if it was just one guy with six guns?

Oh, she's quite proud of herself.

Promise me boys.

Right now.

This is some heavy shit. This is like Lone Ranger-heavy man. Fuck it! There's so much shit that pisses me off. You guys should recruit 'cause I am sick and fuckin' tired of walkin' down the street waitin' for one of these assholes to get me, y'know?

What are you serious?

Hey. You don't know that shit for sure.

Hello?

Roc. You okay?

Roc. You okay?

No. You sure you're okay?

Those rat fucks! All of them were all laughing at me man!

Worst day of my life, man.

Shit!... Shit! He ain't here.

You bet your ass he will.

We'll keep going, Roc.

Why have you come to a church for council if you're not religious?

But in this day and age I believe what they do is... necessary. I feel it is... correct.

Yes.

You're right.

I want to stand for what I believe in, father.

Don't do this my son.

Poppa Joe, you want me to go now?

Hey, Rocco, wait. Come back here.

OK. That's wrong.

Plus where's Huggie Bear?

This is he?

That's true. But what if they change the locks?

Now that window can never be locked. It's impossible.

How was I ridiculing you?

Is it back in?

OK. Escape route. The most important thing you can have is an escape route. Just in case somebody's tailing us. Or even chasing us, as the case may be --

Where's the manager?

Holy shit.

Yeah.

Can I get that credit card from you?

See if mine are in there.

I'll just say it.

You owe me fifty bucks.

See, now we've got a plan.

That coward. Son of a bitch.

If you wanted to go? What were you going to do? Just leave me here by myself?

I wish I'd been there.

I have an idea for that.

Inez has a master key to all these rooms, doesn't she?  Doesn't she?

I don't think we need any keys, Dignan. I think I can hotwire a car for us.

You gave $383 to the goddamn housekeeper! What the fuck is your problem?

A $500 tip! For the housekeeper!

That's what she is!

Who's in the car?

I want you to look at this.

It's big, Anthony. Real big. It's called Hinckley Cold Storage.

What exactly is this place? Freezers?

Dignan. Take it easy.

OK. Man in blue jeans just left by southwest door. He is entering a white van. What time is it?

You're all clear.

Not at all. The place is totally deserted.

What's happening? What's going on?

Who did that? What the fuck is that?

You're kidding.

How big is it?

What's he in for?

Scale the barricade and tunnel through no man's land. And Bob. Remember:

You know, your form is for shit, but you've got a hell of a talent.

I'd like to live in that place. Hinckley Cold Storage.

You mean a safecracker?

Tell me something. What the hell kind of name is Dignan?
