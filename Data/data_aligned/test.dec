Well, there's someone I think might be --

You're sweet.

I really, really, really wanna go, but I can't.  Not unless my sister goes.

Who knows?  All I've ever heard her say is that she'd dip before dating a guy that smokes.

I believe we share an art instructor

I was?

What good stuff?

Let's go.

Expensive?

It's just you.

The prom?  Kat has a date?

It's that hot rod Joey, right? That ' s who you want me to bend my rules for?

You're not going unless your sister goes.  End of story.

Never

Yeah, but these guys have never seen a horse.  They just jack off to Clint Eastwood.

Bianca Stratford.  Sophomore. Don't even think about it

Unlikely, but even so, she still can't go out with you.  So what's the point?

Are you kidding?  He'll piss himself with joy.  He's the ultimate kiss ass.

It's her favorite band.

Hell, I've just been going over the whole thing in my head and -

The hell is that?  What kind of 'guy just picks up a girl and carries her away while you're talking to her?

Yeah -- we'll see.

I've retrieved certain pieces of information on Miss Katarina Stratford I think you'll find helpful.

Sure

Forget it.

Does this conversation have a purpose?

What?  We took bathes together when we were kids.

You could always go with me.  I'm sure William has some friends.

Oh, honey -- tell me we haven't' progressed to full-on hallucinations.

I don't really think you warrant that strong an emotion.

And why would I do that?

You -- covered in my vomit.

That's what you want, isn't it?

Hey man. . .  You don ' t think I can be "cool"?  You don't think I can be "laid back" like everyone else?

I'm gettin' there

BIANCA

Unwelcome.

Other than my upchuck reflex? Nothing.

Yeah, well, don't let it get out

For. . . ?

No one else knows

You need therapy.  Has anyone ever told you that?

What?

You were paid to take me out!  By -- the one person I truly hate.  I knew it was a set-up!

Is that right?

So what I want doesn't matter?

I want to go to an East Coast school! I want you to trust me to make my own choices.  I want --

Yeah.  She left with some bikers Big ones.  Full of sperm.

Parts of it.

The part where Bianca beat the hell out of some guy.

What's the matter?  Upset that I rubbed off on her?

When I go?

Expressing my opinion is not a terrorist action.

Just smack her now.

I'm likin' you guys better

It says here you exposed yourself to a group of freshmen girls.

What's to discuss?

I am, Your Eminence

Thank God...

Forgive me, Don Bobadilla -- those positions have already been taken.

I am afraid this is not the worst news.

There'll be a time.

Yes... Yes, I do... On all of them!

This time with me!

He asks when he can come to visit you.  He left his address.

No?

If you won't accept our proposal, we'll simply find someone who will.

Chief says...

That's what it says.

To open a new route to Asia.  At the moment there are only two ways of reaching it...

Give me absolution.

Oh?  So you are a new man?

No more than the woman who said she would take Granada from the Moors.

If you want to keep your head on your shoulders, you'll do as I say.

Savagery is what monkeys understand.

Twenty eight.

Immediately.

You think I don't know that?

Yes, Your Majesty.

We weren't expecting immediate profits, were we?  We must have faith.  We must give time for time.

Give me another one, please.

Alright.  That's a justifiable homicide.

Somewhere else?

In the kitchen.

Daphne, I...

I'm from a small town in Slovakia.  Like the South here.  The Police is right, a civilian is wrong.  So I fled.

Look, after Jordy briefs me, you can do the press conference.  How about that? The case is all yours.

Okay.  But not water sports.

End my career?

Yeah.

A timer.

Still unknown but we're running prints. Kid over there caught the case.

It's okay.

Yeah.

Stay with her.

We don't have her I.D. yet, but one of your girls was killed last night at the King Edward Hotel.

He had a videocamera?  Where is she? Quickly!

You were right, they were both dead before the fire.  The male was stabbed so hard the killer broke off the tip of the knife in his spine.  That's usually an indicator of something personal.

I'm on duty.

Raw deal.

My point exactly.

Hey.  I'm a professional.

No, I don't think you were a fool, I just think you were stupid about it.  I mean, to say the least, you outta know better.  You don't know her well enough. She's got the potential to fucking hang you even if she suggests that you made a pass at her, it's fuckin' over.  You can deny it all you want, but it will not make one fucking bit of difference. You're dead.

What do you want?

Then do it, asshole.

Alright.

Hey.

Yeah, well you took the camera and put it right down on the evidence.  That was...

That's good.

You're worried for my safety.  I'm touched.

Dog food.

Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.

My father was.  He gave me many lessons about fire.  Now it's my friend.

You'll be my first.

Let her go!  Let her go!!

How long are you planning to stay?

Do you know how much killer gets for movie rights?

Okay.

I want to document my trip to America.

Smell like chemicals...for smoking drugs.

I'll do it.  Don't hurt my camera!

Whatever we do - we fuck her, right?

Sit down!

The one who got caught in the bathroom.  George Michael.

Shut up.  Look!

Bad last moment - I cut it out.

Surprise!  Surprise!

I can't talk to anybody right now, can't you see I'm busy!  I can't talk business.  Hang up.  Have a drink.  Get her a whiskey.

What do you mean you know?  He told you he was gonna propose to me?

I want to hear everything he said.

Oh my G-d.  We were having lunch here. He started making overtures - talking about little shoes next to his in his closet but I got a call to anchor - and I walked out on him.  I walked out on him when he was trying to ask me to marry him!!

Yeah, well, some people got their priorities straight.

I used an accelerant.

But you knew that, right?

Yeah?

How long they been livin' here?

Not good.

I'm afraid I've only got a few minutes, but I'd love to.

Okay, come on down.

Yes. You must have heard the rumour that went around during orbital check-out.

Oh, well, apparently there's something about the mission that the sleeping beauties know that we don't know, and that's why we were trained separately and that's why they were put to sleep before they were even taken aboard.

That seems very unlikely.

Of course, it would be very easy for us to find out now.

I guess it isn't.

Well... Hal's reported the AO-unit about to fail again.

I think I'll have to go out and burn them off.

He's got a point.

What is it, Hal?

Sure, Dave, what's up?

And don't you worry about it.

Yes, I remember you mentioning it. I got mine about the same time.

Well, what is it?

Thank you, Daddy.

How is gregor?

I'm terribly sorry. I was just on my way down to meet you. I saw your ship dock and I knew I had plenty of time, and I was on my way out of the office when, suddenly, the phone rang.

Are you quite sure?

Are you, by any chance, going up to your base at Clavius?

How can you tell it was deliberately buried?

Tomb, shine, survey-marker spare part, take your choice.

I don't think it has, but I'd like to check that. Simpson, what's the log on that?

We're scheduled to dock in about seven hours. Is there anything we can do for you?

Well... the crew is confined to the ship when we land at Clavius. We have to stay inside for the time it take to refit - about twenty-four hours. And then we're going to back empty.

True.

Hal, I'm going out now to replace the A.O. unit.

Hal, check all airlock doors secure.

Hammond.

Whaddya mean, buy?

Excuse me, baby, but if i don't get some action tonight, I'm gonna bust.  You interested?

Oh ... You're a schoolteacher...

Yeah, i been waiting three years.

No, it's gotta be here and now. Believe me. Only I don't have the damn money for a room...

Here's hoping, baby...

Try Cates.  And let's talk in private, okay?

Not likely, Reggie.  Maybe I just need some help.

Ganz is in jail.  He's gonna be there two years after I'm on the street.

What gang you talkin' about, Jack?

Just an expression man, don't mean nothin'.

Just throw me the Goddamn gun.

I think you better put him on ice, man.

She's got the same complaint as half the Goddamn population.  She can't get the job she's trained for and it pisses her off... Anyway, what the fuck do you care?

But you can handle it all right, huh? Real amazin' how far a gun and a badge can carry some cats...

I thought you said bullshit and experience are all it takes.

You wanna leave, man?  Let me take care of Ganz all by myself.

I'm impressed with you too, Jack you did a real good job of busting up a couple of dykes bedded down for the night.

One thing's for sure, Jack. That's how you'll tell the story.

Me and my bunch hit a dealer in the middle of a sale. It's the kind of money nobody ever reports stolen. I was sittin' pretty, livin' in the high cotton, then somebody fingered me for another job. ... Some psycho who's out there capping people with some cop's gun.

Get this. We ain't partners. We ain't brothers. We ain't friends. If Ganz gets away with my money, you're gonna be sorry we ever met.

I'm tellin' you the man's in love... he wants to be a hero for his girl.

I let women get to me.  The quest for pussy is the meaning of life ... I got my own personal philosophy about 'em.  Keep women separate from guns, money and business ... women are for spending money.  They got nothing to do with helping you make it.

If they don't tell me what I need to know...

I can just take her right across the street to Luther's hotel.  All I need is some money for the room.

Luther's on the move...

Yeah, too bad.  They were real nice lookin' too...In bed together, hardly any clothes one watching TV...

I've got to play it rough with them. If they know anything, I'm gonna know it.

Hey, Jack, real men don't have to go in for that macho bullshit ... but I was fantastic.

I didn't have the time.

The truth hurts, doesn't it, buddy?

Backup man from the East Bay. Worked with Ganz a few years ago and sprung him from the road gang.

So do you...been a long day.

Aw, bullshit, you heard wrong.

Nothing came in for me yet?  No calls?

I'm heading out. How about you?

You're hopeless.

What's wrong with that?

What makes you think I have any clean shirts at my place?

What do you want to know?  What difference does it make?  I'm the guy in your bed the last three months.  I make you feel good. You make me feel good.  What the hell else do you want from a guy?

I didn't get burned, two cops did. Listen, I'll tell you about personnel responsibility.  I like to get the job done right.  And if I don't get my job done right... I'm for shit.

Elaine, look, I'm in the middle of sone stuff right now... I'm not gonna have time to come by. I don't know when I can get there.

Elaine! I... I'm sorry... I was expecting somebody else... police business.

We and my pal here have been taking it on the chin for the last few hours...

I've been better...Dead end.  No Ganz, no Indian.

That's what I always say.

Name's Hammond, Reggie Hammond. I heard a lot about you. And any friend of Jack's is a friend of mine.

That's no bull.

In all due respect, he sounds kind of pathetic to me.  The kind of guy that runs home to his momma or some girlfriend.  Have you two ace detectives checked that out?

Hot?  Hey, they're not even room temperature.

Don't give me this, we were partners.

No! Don't kill her.  I can get you the money.

Honest. The place we stashed it opens Monday morning. I can't get it till then. Monday morning, that's when it opens. After that, I'll get the money to you right away...

You try to mess with us or go to the cops, I promise you, I'll put holes in her you wouldn't believe.

What are you talkin' about? I said I wouldn't hurt her.

Not bad, not bad.

Corn-i-Lius?

I'm fucked!

Destroying a glass is one thing..killing people with the weapons you produce is quite another.

I know...

So you do know her.

Is that the usual way priests go on vacation?

Good luck..

Thank you, Mr. President.

What is?

The Supreme Being, the fifth element is here, in our parish!!! It's a miracle!!!

Listen, the last time I admitted to a woman I loved her ... I never saw her again.

They are... with me...

You still pining for that two timing bitch. Forget her. There are a million women out there.

In your dreams! See you tonight!

So, just how big was this fare?

Time is of no importance, only life is important.

...And now you're making fun of me? I'm warning you! If you don't take me after all these years of sacrifice, I'll never forgive you!!

How you doing this morning?  Sleep OK? I didn't.

I had the worst goddamn nightmare.

Anyone know how to release the lines on this crate?

He's on vacation.

What mission?

Old tricks are the best tricks eh?

Why not?

Not hard to find you...just follow the Chaos...

Learning language.

I want to sleep... forever...

Exactly.

Uh..

You're welcome..

I'm about to, Mr. President.

Yes, Mr. Zorg, I hear you perfectly! So, how was the concert?

Yes, Sir!

You know, Amy, I've been sitting around in bars and everywhere following this guy... I mean, is this what I get first thing?  Before you even "hello," you accuse me... ?

We've been all through that.  I've been on my best behavior.

Business was fine.  I'll tell you what, you couldn't pay me enough to live down there.

Why the gun?

... What's going on?

I wanted to call.  I couldn't.

There ain't no such thing as snuff. Why don't you fuck off?

I'm camera shy.

Right here.

Where are the women?

We do.

Well, that's all I can do.  Sorry.

I know what you did.

You killed that girl and you put it on film.  You and your pals, you're fucked.  You fucked up real good.

Why?

Tell me what happened.

Nobody saw you bring her in?

That's right, you just stood there and watched, because you "felt like it."  Almost makes you worse.

I had three jerkoffs trying to return your tapes last month.  Do you know how bad a skin flick has to be for some jackass to come back into my place with a fucking receipt, and try to fucking return it?

The only thing wrong is the cheap, softcore crap you're peddling, Eddie.  Where do you get this stuff?

That's right.

I was well compensated.

I tear off the cover and paste this one on...  You know how it is.

Three, four years.

How much?

Tomorrow night, I get off at eight.

Wake up, pops.  Your education begins tonight.

Interesting theory.

Snuff films.

Yeah, I'm a real genius.  What choices have I got?  Fuck, just because I know about stuff like tonight doesn't mean I deal it.  I work a job.  It beats pumping gas, beats making hamburgers.

You can't sit there all day watching the parade of losers that comes into that place without going numb.  So what? Am I gonna go off and be a race car driver?  Go to Harvard?  Run for President?  What about you, pops?

So, you have a wife and kid waiting for you in Pennsylvania... what are you doing mixed up in all this?

See ya.

I told you, he's one of Dino Velvet's stock players...

Nobody knows his name.  That's his thing.  He always wears a mask.  You never see his face.  He calls himself "Machine," that's what they call him.  Machine.

"Devil" frightened me as much as it excited me, but I'd be hard pressed to choose a favorite.

He's a lawyer.  Please, sit, here...

I've been privileged to provide services for people I admire.

My condolences.

Mostly.  That's where he started his empire building.  He was a good man.  Notorious as an eccentric, but that was something he cultivated.  He wanted to be legendary.

We were married forty-five years. Hard even for me to imagine.  We had our troubles.  There were plenty of places for him to be other than here, but he was always loyal to me, and I to him.  I loved him deeply.

No.

Okay, I follow you so far...

I'm here.

You're one hell of a detective, Mrs. Christian.

Mrs. Christian, Tom Welles here.

How will I get it to you?

Yes, but...

She didn't seem herself.  For months there never was any way to get her to talk about it.  One night we went to bed... the next morning she was gone.  She took some clothes.

I don't know.

You try going through what we did. Bob couldn't take it, that's all. Christ, there's times when it still seems like I can't either.

Okay.

No.

Mrs. Mathews?  It's Thomas.  Do you remember, I was there a few weeks ago... asking about your daughter...

She went to California, to Los Angeles... she wanted to start over. She wanted to be an actress...

Who is this... ?

She was the kindest, sweetest girl you'd ever want to meet.  Oh, I adored her.  I supposed I always hoped she'd be back.  After a time, all I could do was pray she had moved on to better things.  Can you get this suitcase to her parents, if you think it's appropriate?

He's an imbecile.  I tried to warn my daughter, but what can you do?

Yes, Mister Welles, thank you.

What's wrong?

I can't find him.

I haven't slept much either.  Since Kristen...

When I used to have nightmares.  I brought my friends in to help me.  Until they all started dying.

You'll hear all kinds of stories. They'll tell you it was murder, but it wasn't.

Tell him I was looking for him, okay?  I'm Dan.

It was no suicide.  It was not an accident.  It was Freddy, and he's coming back for seconds, thirds, and fourths.

Kristen was the last child left of the people who killed Freddy.  Maybe Freddy can't get to new kids without someone like me.  Someone to bring them to him.

It's okay, we're just about there.

You know, I get the weirdest feeling we've been through this before.

Debbie.  She's gone.  I've...collected her, like the others.

Let me talk to you.

Now it gets weird.  She says he comes back in dreams.  If he kills you there, you're dead for real.

Mother, you've just murdered me.  Take that to your goddamn therapy...

Avoid-all-contact-day.

And ours.  It's our grandchild.

You're not taking my baby!

Who said I...wait, what?

Me too.

No.  A deal's a deal.

You sure you don't want a ride to work?

Daddy, he's coming back...Krueger's coming back.  Make them understand.

No, I'm not.  I sort of hope it's a boy. Be nice to have a boy playing in the house again.

There aren't any little boys on your floor.

They're waiting for us...but let's keep this dream stuff between you and me.

Yeah...So that's him.  And you're not crazy.

That's okay.  He's got the rest of his life to catch up on his sleep.

Well we gotta do something!

Yeah.  I'm just aces.

Pimples, heartburn, cellulite... and no modeling career.

Naah, I'm done.  Got to be on shift in a couple hours.  Aren't you going in?

Pushy parents can make you more than a bit crazy.

All of us.  Right?

It was moderate.  He'll be all right.  But it was out of the question, his coming along.

<u>You</u> said it.  But I won't argue -

Then...this is a 'flying saucer?'

But Julie's a nice girl, and I've seen you work.  She deserves a fighting chance!

<u>That's</u> the worst possible moment?

A lot of people think like that.

Sounds like it!  Distress call, from a small freighter, between Ellesmere Island and Greenland. One mayday, then...nothing.

Skipper!  Look at the depth gauge!

Listen!  Hear that?

The sound again?

We'll have to look for them later.

What's goin' on in here, Lad? What - ?

What???

The frogmen?

Yes, Griff?

Anything ---

<u>We</u> harness energy on a small scale by cutting magnetic lines of force.  Maybe Cyclops does it on a <u>super</u> scale....

What direction does the system indicate?

Nothing we can do, now.

Minus three.

I have selected you, to return with me - along with several other specimens, for study.  We will examine you and the others, discover desirable features to incorporate in our 'earth-colonizers.'

I'll be another!

All right - go to it.

Been putting my files into it. You take sugar and milk?

Has anybody offered to buy it?

Twombley involved?

Same old shit.

Tell me.

You can't buy Wade off.

You think so.

LaRiviere's having a hell of a time in there. Master of fucking ceremonies.

Got you for -- 450, 500 bucks? 

Relax, Chief. We're leaving. You wanna toke?

Some job. Here, have a hit. Don't be such a hardass. I know you got problems, but everybody's got problems. 

Right!

A half mile in, along the old lumber road.

What blood?

What the fuck you telling me, Wade? I never seen the guy get shot, I told you that.

Let's get the fuck outta here. You're not making any sense, man.

Yeah.

I don't care. They're out.

Break stuff?

To us it was.

I don't want to.

No I didn't see anybody I know. No I don't want to go to school here tomorrow. I want to go home.

Yes.

No.

I want to go home.

Where's the plow?

What am I -- a security guard? You hired me, you and your Selectman friends.

Fuck you.

I shoulda sent you instead of Jack.

It ain't done, if that's what you mean.

So?

Don't light that in here. I'm allergic.

You two, don't you get it? He's using you. You're his slaves.  Jesus Christ, Jack, don't you see that?

Yeah, you can have the key. It's the key that's kept me locked to you all these years. I give it to you with pleasure.  Now I'm free. See how easy it is, Jack? All you got to do is give back what the man gave you, and you're free of him.  I've got to call my brother.

Where's Jill?

Yeah.

Don't cause a scene. No one's trying to win any 'rounds'. Don't make it any worse.

Let the past be.  I'm sorry about your mother. I liked her. You never know how much women like that suffer. It's like they live their lives with the sound turned off -- and then they're gone.

Yeah, lots.

You know what I'm talking about. For what you're doing to me and to the child you say you love so much. Love. You won't get away with it.

Said what?

Forget it.

The Mafia hire Jack Hewitt?

What way?

It's nice.

There's another thing I've been thinking about. I don't know how you feel about the idea, Margie, because we've never talked about it. But I've been thinking lately, I've been thinking we should get married sometime. You and me.

Wade.

Jesus Christ, Pop, let's go home. I got waylaid. Sorry.

I'm issuing you a ticket. Moving violation.

Don't ever put your hands on me, Mr. Gordon.

Well, yeah, I suppose. Sure. I just had a little business to settle with Mr. Gordon. I'm the local police officer.

What?

His office. You mean my old office.

He got his deer yet?

A lesson in work and its rewards. You'll thank me for this one day.  Sally, turn off that TV!

Nothing.

In the living room.

You think you can take me now? Come on, try.

Twombley.

No thanks. I don't drink.

What about her?

For what?

Well, you aren't the President, dear.

I'm sure he's busy.

I know, Mom.  It was great... really.

I'm sorry, honey.

Some kids were teasing you?

Big secret.  You said the same thing to Newsweek.

You must be tired. It'll wake you up.

Smart for your age, eh? Top of your class? Tell me, do you know what the word &quot;propaganda&quot; means?

Got it.

Copy Air Force One. Welcome to the party.

Stay cool.

We don't know that.

That kid's name was Jim Marshall.

We've got four hours before they make it into Turkienistan airspace.

Iraqi's won't buy it. Either they're already in on this or they'll think we're spying.

Nine.

why did they do that?

Tower, here.

The President and I were delighted that we could accommodate you.  Now if you're all cleared?  You can follow me then.

Maria... Maria Mitchell.

What do you want with us?

That was war.

Over my dead body.

You don't like seeing people get hurt. Now in morality, that is a virtue. In politics, however, that is weakness.  You were a hostage to everyone else *                    long before you were a hostage to

Okay, Gentlemen, we'll take no action until we confirm that the president is off the plane... Lee, go huddle with the D.O.D. I want an options paper on this in 20 minutes.

They've gotta be joking.

We can't jump from here or at this speed. But if we could get a message out - tell the refueling plane...

She's a big girl.  She understands.

And when have I had five minutes? When I wake up in the morning and I'm already three hours behind Schedule.  What do you want me to do, Rose, tell the G7 to fuck off because I'm a family man?

What?

I should trust that promise? Because you know the voters are still waiting for that middle class tax cut.

Well, they aren't burning me in effigy. That's always a good sign.

Flying the plane.

Excuse me?

But...

This is the President.

Don't cut me off. This is an emergency.

Look lady, I don't have time for games. Just put the....

We'll just say it was in bad taste.

That's my job.

Yes, sir.

Okay.  Hey, pumpkin, you'll tell me all about it later, right?

DO YOU SEE TEEM?

Commissioner.

I just wish it was that simple.

I was reading too.

Te...!

Ask Simon.

Ted, please.  You're just making things difficult for yourself.

Ted, I loved you and I'll always love you. But I need Simon.  He's stable.  He's a good provider.  I want that at this stage of the game, Ted.  He might have his faults, but Simon doesn't know the meaning of the word fear and I need that in a man.

Then you <u>do</u> think I'm insane.

What word would you use, Elaine?

Ted!

Compute!

The human brain is a highly complex organ, Elaine, perhaps the most complex next to the bladder.  Let me show you.  Ted's problem is in this area.  This area, this area, here, here, here, under here, here...

And I can hardly believe that I'm engaged to someone like you, Simon.  I'm a very lucky woman.

But, darling, they've offered me a chance to head up the computer analysis division for the Jupiter probe.

I'm so excited, Simon.

No, I've been excited before.

Maybe.

No, I mean you can do it from the cockpit.

Cut the Doubting Thomas shit, Elaine.  I know where I'm coming from on this.

We'll have to check, Jimmy.  It's a pretty long trip to Mercury.

I don't want to hear that word!

What?

Do you think it's necessary to explain <u>everything</u>?

Yes.

Do you have an appointment, sir?

Don't try to stop me!

People change in relation to each other. Love changes on its own.

Well, after a thing like that you wouldn't be expected to.

Shep, no! He gets so excited when new people are here.

Can you fly this airplane and land it?

I'm not sure. I haven't seen anything like this since the Lina Wertmuller Film Festival.

A hospital? What is it?

No.

Well...

That's the way I've always wanted it to be, Elaine.

Ted, I don't want to stay here. It's time for us to go back home -- to the plans we made before the war.

Oh, Bill, I'll keep it. I'll keep it with me all the time.

Bill! Bill! Good-bye, Bill.

Well, it wasn't all that I had hoped.

Oh, Stewardess. My husband is very sick. Can you do something, please?

Hi, Roger. Good to have you aboard. Victor, this is Roger Murdock.

All right. But just remember, my name is Roger Murdock.

Oh yes, I saw. Poor child.

Thank you.

Oh -- I haven't flown for a long time.

That's right.

You ever try to make a case in Slagtown?  The list of Newcomer informants is about as long as the list of Mexican war heroes...

I'd like to see you next to a sea of hydrochloric acid, Fedorchuk... see how much surfin' you'd do.

Yes...

Sergeant... Detective.  I wasn't aware there were any Newcomers at the rank of Detective yet.

This is becoming a serious breach of security.

This is getting out of hand.  I want you to deal with it.  Immediately.

His body was discovered three days ago, in an alley off of Central Avenue, near downtown.

Through the chest.  Rupturing both the primary and secondary hearts.

And that fits?

How the hell do you know that?

We'd like to ask you about a business associate of your, Warren Hubley.

Screw me?  That can't be right.

Stay back!  I'm okay.

Our bodies do not assimilate the nutrients if the food has been cooked.

Todd Watson.  The assistant manager.

When will Strader return?

My wife?  She worries about me.

Yeah, go home.  Get some sleep.  You do sleep, don't you?

To the... to the beach?

Warren Hubley was in middle management at a refinery... Joshua Strader operated a successful bar and nightclub...

You must leave me alone on this.

We all did.

No... I am sure not.  That is why I am so concerned... someone must now be producing it here.  But none of my people know how to make it.  The process was carefully guarded.

I must trust you, Matthew.  I cannot stop this without you.

Harcourt was the brain who brought it all together.

If the drug is here, we must destroy it.

Where is the drug?  Where have they taken it?

It'd be for your own good.  I think you'd be better off with a partner who's a little more... by the book.  ... Still, I gotta tell you, George, for a quiet guy, you're sure hell on wheels once you get going.  I'd kinda hate to miss your next two days as a detective.

Because... because of what will happen if humans see what we are capable of becoming.

What is it?

No... two.

We think he could'a been involved, yeah.  You know him?

Sure.  Just a minute.

The human?

You mean the Blob?  They're finishing up now.

Put on your wash-and-wear suit and your clip-on tie, have your landlady tie your shoes for you, and show up at the church.  Simple.  Me and Carol are going.

Position?

Awright!  I want a nice clean dispersal this time.

Vasquez, take point.  Let's move.

Let's go.  Pull 'em out.

Say again?  All after incinerators?

See you soon.

Well, thanks, I --

You'd drifted right through the core systems.  It's blind luck that deep-salvage team caught you when they...are you all right?

Cancer.  Hmmmm.  They still haven't licked that one.  Cremated.  Interred Parkside Repository, Little Chute, Wisconsin.  No children.

They had their minds made up before I even went in there. They think I'm a head case.

I heard you were working in the cargo docks.

What if I said I could get you reinstated as a flight officer? And that the company has agreed to pick up your contract?

Uh-hunh.  One of thirty or so, all over the planet.  They're completely automated.  We manufacture them, by the way.

Don't make me pull rank, Ripley.

But they will know about it, Burke. From me.  Just like they'll know how you were responsible for the deaths of one hundred and fifty-seven colonists here --

Sorry to disappoint you.

They're but off!  Do something!

Is this going to be a stand-up fight, Sir, on another bug-hunt?

How do I get out of this chicken-shit outfit?

I don't fucking believe this. Do you believe this?

Let's get these things lit.

Maybe.  Maybe not.

Yeah.  I've noticed.

Stand back.

No.  Have you?

Look, man, let's just bug out and call it even, okay?

Maybe you haven't been keeping up on current events, but we just got out asses kicked, pal!

You're just reading me.

Yeah, right, it runs from the processing station right into the sublevel here.

How?  The transmitter was on the APC.  It's wasted.

Think of what?  We're fucked.

How long have I been on Gateway station?

Newt.  My n-name's Newt. Nobody calls me Rebecca except my dork brother.

They're dead.

I'm sorry, Newt.

I don't want to...I have scary dreams.

Isn't that how babies come? I mean people babies...they grow inside you?

You mean dead.

Right here, baby.  Right here.

That's because I blew it out the Goddamn airlock!  Like I said.

Because I don't have to.  The people who live there checked it out years ago and they never reported and 'hostile organism' or alien ship.  And by the way, they call it Acheron now.

Good morning.

Really? What else did he tell you today? Give me some gossip.

Well even if there is, I don't think you want to get involved with this one.

Well, do you know where it's set, my dear?

A Turkish brothel.

My dear, it will hardly enhance your reputation to be celebrated throughout Vienna as a singing prostitute for a Turk.

Don't bother.

Is her mother still lying on the floor?

Sir -

Oh, Your Grace - I thank Your Grace! I thank you!

How much provocation am I to endure from you? The more license I allow you, the more you take.

Who the devil are you? What do you want?

Go ahead, tell him. Tell them all. They won't understand you anyway.

Sra-I'm-sick! Sra-I'm sick!

No, no. Say it backwards, shit-wit. Sra-I'm-sick Say it backwards!

Ui-vol-i-tub!

They'll come anyway. They love me here.

You borrowed money from your mother?

I love you! I love you!

Wolfi! Your father is dead.

Stanzi-manzi, I'll put it in your hand!

No one.

Please! Let me sit here. Let me stay here with you. I promise I won't say all word. I'll just be here, so you know no one's going to hurt you. Please, please!

That's right, Your Excellency. I've come on behalf of my hus band. I'm - I'm bringing some samples of his work so he can be considered for the royal appointment.

No, sir. This is my own idea.

That's very tempting, but it's impossible, I'm afraid. Wolfi would be frantic if he found those were missing. You see, they're all originals.

Oh yes. He's really proud of his work.

He asked me to stay.

You know what's ridiculous? Your libretto, that's what's ridiculous. Only an idiot would ask Wolfi to work on that stuff!

But you can't take her without reference. It's unheard of!

And what do you expect? Who wants to walk out into a mess like this every day?

So you are! The place is a pigsty all the time.

Be careful!

Hey!

I'd like a little wine, if you have it.

Majesty.

Ah-ha!

Well, there it is. Now to business. Young man, we are going to commission an opera from you. What do you say?

Excuse me, Sire, but what do you think these could be? Being a foreigner, I would love to learn.

Really?

It's actually quite amusing, Majesty. It's set - the  whole thing is set in a - in a -

Which few did you have in mind, Majesty?

Enchanted, Madame.

Well - Well we haven't quite received my father's consent, Your Majesty. Not entirely. Not altogether.

What is it?

Well, six or seven minutes! maybe eight!

He's here.

I will.

Is she not here?

They say you're in debt.

Yes.

Composition doesn't pay. You know that.

Why didn't you mention it in your letters?

I want you to come back with me to Salzburg, my son.

No one calls you that.

Good morning, sir.

Of course not. You're a good girl. You're very kind to do this. Next time you're sure they'll be out of the house, let me know, will you?

I'm frightened, sir. Really! When he speaks, he doesn't make any sense. You know he said he saw - he said he saw his father. And his father's dead.

I suppose so. He sits there all he time, doing some silly opera.

Are you Herr Mozart?

Sublime! Utterly sublime!

And which one of them do you want me to teach?

Of course, it's him. Who do you think it is?

Strudel, this is Herr Mozart. Say good morning.

No doubt, sir. But I am endowed with talent, and you with money. If I offer mine, you should offer yours.

Please. I'll give it back, I promise. Please, sir.

Did you like it, then?

Your Excellency, you requested some specimens of my work. Here they are. I don't have to tell you how much I need your help. I truly appreciate your looking at these. I have pressures on me - financial pressures. As you know, I'm a married man now.

She is well. She is - well, actually, I'm about to become a father! She only told me last night. You are the first to know.

You don't mean to tell me you are living in poverty?

Come, come, Mozart; I'm interested. Truly.

It's unbelievable! The Director has actually ripped out a huge section of my music. Pages of it.

Oh no! My wife took it out in time.

Oh, Excellency, would you?

Thank you! Oh, thank you.

I think you overestimate our dear Viennese, my friend. Do you know you didn't even give them a good bang at the end of songs so they knew when to clap?

Who are you?

How much?

I'm taking you home. You're not well.

You're so good to me. Truly. Thank you.

Do you mean that?

The doctor thinks I am. But -

We ended in F Major?

What time?

Please! Just one moment.

I think so.

Yes!

I'm not leaving you.

I - I don't think you have, Herr Director. Not yet. I mean, it's quite n - Of course, I'll show it to you immediately.

Taking out what you should never have put in.

What is what?

Because His Majesty wishes it.

On the contrary.

Mozart -

You tried to take your life. You do remember that, don't you?

Do you understand that you have sinned? Gravely.

That makes no difference. All men are equal in God's eyes.

I know a little. I studied it in my youth.

Here in Vienna.

I didn't. That was Mozart. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. You know who that is?

Ah - you've heard that?

He was murdered, Father! Mozart! Cruelly murdered.

Did you try?

You cannot say that!

My son, no one can speak for God.

What difference does that make?

Exactly.

Never mind.

Excuse me - didn't His Majesty specifically forbid ballet in his opera?

Yes, in the third act.

Oh. Well, thank you! How wonderful. Some people get all the luck.

Who is she?

Of course.

What do you mean, 'how did he look'?

Miss Gallagher, surely you must perform some function here at the hospital.

Dr. Hirsch?

Yes, Doctor?

Yes, I believe he did.

Alex, has David persisted in his werewolf fantasies?

They were lying. There were no witnesses, no escaped lunatic. The whole community is hiding the truth of what actually happened up there.

David has suffered a severe trauma. I myself witnessed some form of mass neurosis in East Proctor. If all the villagers believe that Jack Goodman was killed by a werewolf, why shouldn't David? And then it follows that if he survived an attack by a werewolf, wouldn't he himself become a werewolf the next full moon?

Have you read the papers today? Have you listened to the radio or television?

Is David acting strangely?

How is that?

Call me Alex.

Will you give me a break?

It's okay. I want to talk to you.

Will you come with me?

I'm serious. You don't know me and I know nothing about you. We have a perfect relationship.

Now I'm embarrassed.

Charming.

Of course.

I wasn't hallucinating.

Do me an enormous favor?

Okay.

I'm freezing.

What?

David, don't lose control.

No.

No.

Yes, Mrs. Hobbs.

You're going to have to stop this disturbance or I shall arrest you.

This isn't Mr. Goodman's idea. He is your good friend, whereas I am a victim of your carnivorous lunar activities.

No, David. Harry and I and everyone you murder are not dead. The undead.

That's very funny, that is.

You've been unconscious since you were brought in two weeks ago.

Now we've just given you a pretty strong sedative, so try to get some rest now. Miss Price will see to your needs. Rest now.

In time I'm sure it will all come back to you.

Did you see Jack?

Did you talk to the police in East Proctor? Did the cops go to The Slaughtered Lamb?

Of course not, David. I'll fetch in young Miss Price.

I assume full responsibility.

It's a five-pointed star.

I see. You want me to ask these people if they're burning candles to ward off monsters.

Come on, I'm freezing.

Yeah?

I don't know. Come on.

Not far enough. Come on.

Rudy Levine the shmuck?

The wolf's bloodline must be severed. The last remaining werewolf must be destroyed.

Jack, please go away. Please go away.

Nurse!

David, I'm sorry I upset you yesterday, but you must understand what is going on.

You must take your own life now, David, before it's too late.

You must believe me.

You don't have to say anything.

What about the zoo?

I want you to meet some people.

Come in, come in. Please sit. Some tea?

Lt. Villiers and Sgt. McManus are here to see you, Doctor.

I suppose Guinness will suffice.

I'd like some tea, please.

Sgt. McManus, are you suggesting that David and Jack were, in fact, attacked by some animal and that the officialdom of East Proctor has conspired to keep it a secret? We have an autopsy report on the murderer who was shot in the act by the local police. We have two witnesses to the crime. You'll forgive me, Mr. Kessler, if I consider your testimony as coming from someone who has gone through a terrible shock.

Listen, I told you I wasn't interested in that deal, didn't I?

Matt?

The detectives got Matt up there in Sampson's office.

Where do you think I've been?  I took the baby for a stroll in the park.

Oh, is he? We carry more unsecured paper than any other institution in the city. We're fools to tolerate it.

I think, Mr. Dickson, we would like to have a little of your very valuable time here at the bank this morning, if you don't mind.

Just pure luck!

What do you mean, help?

So, that's it, eh? You've waited a long time for this chance, haven't you?  Well, I'm not going to resign now - or ever.

Don't forget there's a dead watchman downstairs.

Gambling - I owed them a lot of money. Last week I lost over fifty thousand dollars!

I know, I know, Dude. Oh, I must have been crazy! I lost my head completely!

But after all, you can't take blood from a stone.

Am I? Why, I - I don't know any reason why I should be, unless of course it's you . . .

Well, you can. You always could.

Line?

Well

Well, aren't you going to invite me?

Oh, you're not so badly off. There's something much worse than being a misunderstood wife.

A misunderstood bachelor.

I'm listening.

No?  Then maybe you'll understand, Mrs. Dickson. Oh, gee, he's crazy about you. Nobody knows it better than you. If he ever finds out, it'll kill him.

This is my business. Mr. Dickson's been like a father to me.  What has he ever done to you to deserve a deal like this?

That's what it was you planned, wasn't it?

You can take some of the girls. You can take Mildred - or Gwynn

Happy now?

In Cluett's apartment? Well dear, you see, I . . . I . . .

Helen, you're becoming more beautiful every day. What are we going to do about it?

Mr. Schaffer will take good care of you. He'll give you fifteen - maybe twenty . . .

Yes, sir.

I don't know. Mr. Sampson bought it for me.

I can't tell you.

Was Mrs. Dickson there?

Wait a minute. Answer my question. Was Mrs. Dickson there?

All right. That's all.  Please, Matt.

Gee, thanks, Mr. Dickson

If he can do it, yes.

What are you talking about? He had no more to do with it than you did.

Listen, Matt. If you don't tell the truth, I can't help you. Where were you last night?

Why, you must be crazy. I've known this man for years.

He says he can't get away in the daytime.

Yes, sir.

All right. Send down to the vaults and have our reserve cash sent up here right away.

Mine too?

What'll we do?

Is it safe?

It's his life insurance money, you know.

Oh, ten dollars

Oh, you think I'm lying?

Come here.  You know, a few minutes ago I was in Cluett's office and Mrs. Dickson was there.

Well, he was making love to her.

He was here?

Are you sure?

That's just what I'm trying to tell you, sir. It was a half hour after the Dooley sisters . . .

Okay, Matt.

Charlie's upstairs as sore as a pup. He's out fourteen cents, and he can't find it.

They're starting to come in already. Yeah. Yeah. Well, listen. Don't waste any time. Get all the money you can lay your hands on, and bring it down here right away. Step on it.

You stay out of this, Bob.

As long as people think Jesse's still riding, we will never get the respect we deserve.

You're just upset about Jesse. We all are.

I can hit those boys from here. We just need a distraction.

Nope.

... Will Perry ...

They said because the detectives were working for the Department of the Interior --

Exactly.

You, ya barrel of pork lard. Here piggy piggy!

There's Yankees back there. Lot's of 'em.

Yeah.

Sorry.

Now the one time one of us comes up with an idea --

I got us through the War all right.

Then let me run the show, General Lee.

You ride like a Comanche.

All right, all right.  Jesse James never yelled at folk...

Yeah, Injun. What do you want?

Me get heap firewater --

Died a hero.

Yesss, but I was thinking, I could come by, and then take Zee out. Some place near. With other folk. Near. Here.  But out.

Zerelda, it's no coincidence. The railroad men come through, offering to buy up land. Nobody sells. Then they start hanging men who own farms for treason?

I think he's already feeling better.

I figure.

I'm sure it seemed like a good idea at the time.

All this time in the saddle... We get to the farm, I'm going to shoot this damn horse just on principle.

Saved all our lives, Doc. None of the Liberty boys would have come home if not for Web Mimms, Doc. God's honest truth.

Maybe, maybe...

I swear I'll shoot you in your sleep.

Your Zee? Hmm.  "From women's eyes this doctrine I derive: they sparkle still the right Promethean fire; They are the books, the arts, the academes, that show, contain, and nourish all the world."

It got to you, didn't it. All the killing in the war. You need it now.

If I could go back to farming --

Got any ideas, little brother?

Railroad burned him out too. You couldn't have stopped him.

But he killed a lot of men, too.

He's a good Christian and he killed Yankees. Jesus told me that made him an all right boy.

We're just fine, thank you, sir.

What you do to me is unfair. The teasing, I mean.

What?

A river pirate.

Were you planning on kissing me when you finished quoting?

I've got you. You keep me busy. I figure we'll get over to the hotel... get checked in, cleaned up... then I'd like to do something I've been thinking about for a long time.

"Hmm" what?

"Blazing Guns of the West. True Stories of Jesse James." Only a dime in the hotel lobby.

I'll explain on the way.

The cows had a brand from a farm just five miles out of town.

I figured.

Should have just killed Thaddeus Rains and been done with it.

You don't think God'll mind, do you?

Yeah. Hey, are you drinking whisky? You're too young to be drinking whisky.

I guess so.

Tonight? Why, I'm just getting ready to turn on the Younger charm.

You do that.

Yes, but just so I could find out who you were.

Could we go upstairs and talk? It's so loud down here.

NO! It is NOT my pleasure to have to leave my board room to come to this godforsaken piece of dirt to discover why in the name of all that is holy you cannot seem to evict a few simple farmers from their PATHETIC LITTLE MUDHOLES so that I may build the GREATEST railroad that this country has ever seen!

THEN WHO DID?!

I look forward to seeing it.

What, sir?

Oh, that. I'll let Jenkins explain.

Not such a menace now, is he, Pinkerton?

Not to mention my men who lost their lives.

Oh no, I would have done that. But I would have made sure I killed them, too.

Would a jury around here convict their own? I think not. We're beginning an interesting game here, Mr. Rains.

All of the James Gang's encounters have been with local law enforcement who, quite frankly, are no match for this group's cunning.

In English, Pinkerton.

Waiting for Luis to call me. He said he'd call tonight. Oh don't be difficult, Patrick.

Am I confused or were we talking about tonight?

Pumpkin you're dating the biggest dickweed in New York.

I'm thinking Dorsia.

Sounds like I'll have to. Don't fall asleep, okay? Wear something fabulous. Dorsia, remember?

Yes.

Is it a what?

I'm ignoring you.

What do you want, Courtney?

Patrick. Turn on the Light. He turns on the light.

Oh God, just get it over with.

I never knew you smoked.

Yes, Courtney?

It's not that nice.

I don't want to talk about it.

Everybody's good-looking, Patrick.

No. I'm not. Why should I ?

It's not.

I'm...in touch with humanity. Evelyn, I'm sorry.  You're just not terribly important to me.

No.

You saw the ad in the Times?

But I think...I want to know what happened here.

I won't...don't worry.

Yes, naturally.

What exactly do you mean?

Davis. I'm not one to bad-mouth anyone, your joke was amusing. But come on, man, you had one fatal flaw: Bateman's such a dork, such a boring, spineless lightweight, that I couldn't fully appreciate it. I wasn't fooled for a second. Now, if you'd said Price, or McDermott...Otherwise, it was amusing. Now, let's have lunch or dinner or something. Hilarious, Davis. A killer.

Wait. Stop. You don't seem to understand. You're not really comprehending any of this. I killed him. I did it, Carnes. I'm Patrick Bateman. I chopped Owen's fucking head off. I tortured dozens of girls. The whole message I left on your machine was true.

I'm not sure, guy, but I don't think dyslexia is a virus.

I want to get high off this; Bateman, not sprinkle it on my fucking All-Bran.

Calm down. Let's do it anyway

But wait. You ain't seen nothin' yet.

Impressive. Very nice. Let's see Paul Owen's card.

Ask me a question.

Leaving what?

Yes, can you take two tonight, oh, let's say at nine o'clock?

Oh really? That's great.

Yes, sir.

Is that the Ransom file? Thanks. Don't wear that outfit again.

Patrick?

Detective Donald KIMBALL?

Bring us an ashtray for Mr. KIMBALL, please. She whisks in with a crystal ashtray as they sit in silence.

No, come on. Anywhere you want.

You can always he thinner. Look...better.

What are I doing?

I m into, well, murders and executions mostly.

What?

Yeah, well, oh boy, listen, I've got to go. Thank you, uh... Victoria?

Next Saturday?

He's a goddamn drug dealer! These are his peak hours.

Why would I?

Does he do this all the time?

Those are Sarah Lawrence guys, Patrick. You're making me feel weird.

Nothing like that. I'm just a private investigator.

No. I'm okay.

The disappearance of Paul Owen.

Harvard. The Harvard Business School.

No problem. 

Well...

He led what I suppose was an orderly life. He... ate a balanced diet.

I hope I'm not being cross-examined here.

No. Not really.

Let me think. The Newport. Harry's. Fluties. Endochine. Nell's. Comell Club. The New York Yacht Club. The regular places.

We were both seven in 1969.

Hmmm.

What?

Absolutely, I'm 100% with you.

Dan, great to see you again. Like I said, you need anything at all, I'm your man. I don't envy your job. I mean Owen was a...complex man.

That's not the information I've received.

Yes, of course. The hash browns are delicious. I'm just...not... ordering them.

I'm not really sure. I had a shower...and some sorbet?

Where was Marcus?

I'm hungry

You re so kind, mister. You're kind. You're a kind man. I can tell.

I've been great. And you?

It's...it's...all right.

I can paint anywhere.

Anything? That's not even credible. If he wants to go up there? To check it out? I think you should encourage him.  It's his life. But everybody's treating him like this -- valuable object. You're hurting your own case.

If he's really a bully, he won't cop to it, anyway.

I think that's great, Milo. I do.

We're not gonna let it.

Nobody does work like this on-line. It's in your PC, or in a mainframe. Self-contained. They'd have to be, like, watching people. Physically.  Oh Jesus.

You're scaring me. I think we should just go.

Is it two? Or is it three? Have you ever really noticed?

I remember.

...Different?

Okay, yeah. I did something naughty... There's this amazing Comix store in Seattle.  To tell you the truth, I did it once or twice at Stanford. 'Guess I can't keep anything from you...

Look at me! I'm gonna change.

I know you. You're gonna run back to work right after dinner. I want my kiss now.

Instead of busting my chops you should do something about that girl. Fire her. Or something.

He wasn't acting?

Right... What's that mean again?

Give me two seconds with Lacy here?  Go on in, I won't be a moment.

No. But you can write your own ticket in the Valley after this. We're gonna bring down Outpost.

Wanna be a part of history?

Gimme the coordinates?

Is it your dish?

Isn't there a stigma? Bankrolling this guy?

Oh hi.

Milo? Gary Boyd. I'm hoping you and your friend can come up here. We've made some amazing strides in digital convergence. I'd love to show them to you.

Would you like a Coke or something?

Skywire.

I do!

Okay. I'm Gary.

Don't spend too much time searching. You ever vetted somebody's old code before?  It's a different skill. Stay close to the surface. The best-hidden secrets are in plain sight. You know the best place to hide a leaf, right?  In a tree.

Maybe I'm going too fast.

Were the flags for Teddy?

It helps. Alice said it would help. To focus on something.  'Don't know what I'd do without her.

34,000. But they're real short lines. 'Just came out that way.

'Have a look?

Don't be so hard on yourself. With a brain like yours, you could connive with the best of 'em I bet.

There may be a little less trust after your outburst.

'Knows I'm altering the coordinates. Let's jump to #12.

In exchange for endowments. They should just drop the pretense and name the schools after 'em.

He was on the verge of something, too. He was gonna show us the next day. He said "The answer's not in the box, it's in the band." Know what it means?

Man, could he write code. Totally elegant. He had his own style.

"There is no second place." Plus every time I get jammed-up, Gary has an inspiration.  Is it like that with your counselor?

Right, right. But does he ever just, like, hand you code?

Oh yeah?

No, no. Never.

But still, you can't say CBS wouldn't love to break something like --

It's a standard GUI. Once I've got a concept, it's maybe three day's work.

What'd he say?

Milo? Shrot suspects somebody broke into #21. I was in his office when he was reviewing the card readouts.

Tell me you're not calling on your car phone?!

Uh. Not exactly.

Jesus, Teddy.

I met this girl.

I don't know.

I've got a girlfriend, remember?

What do you want, Mr... Cunningham, was it?

It's for the mining industry, Mr. Cunningham. We can talk about business later. But first, let me slip into something more comfortable.

Groovy.

Mmmm... I feel extreme relaxation.

Is it about my teeth?

Smashing!

Oh, and Austin...

Yes?

Let me remind you that because of the unfreezing process you might experience flatulence at moments of extreme relaxation.

There's one more thing, Austin.

Be careful.

Austin, Vanessa, let me bring you up to speed. Dr. Evil has high- jacked a nuclear warhead from Kreplachistan and is holding the world ransom for one-hundred billion dollars. If the world doesn't pay up in four days, he's threatening to destroy the world.

That's not your mother, that's a man!

Yes Basil?

Don't try to suck up to me! It's a little late for that. I'm a freak! Look at it, it's been rendered useless.

Oh forget it. As a fellow player on the international stage, Mr.  Powers, I'm sure you'll enjoy watching the curtain fall on the third and final act.

Well done, Mr. Powers. We're not so different, you and I. It's true, you're British, and I'm Belgian. You have a full head of hair, mine is slightly receding. You're thin, I'm about forty pounds overweight. OK, we are different, I'm not making a very good point. However, isn't it ironic, Mr. Powers, that the very things you stand for-- swinging, free love, parties, distrust of authority- are all now, in the Nineties, considered to be... evil? Maybe we have more in common than you care to admit.

Your freedom has cause more pain and suffering in the world than any plan I ever dreamed of. Face it, freedom failed.

If it's a lie, goddamn her. It it's the truth, goddamn me.  God, I hope that's witty. How's your mum?

Listen, Mr. Powers, I look forward to working with you, but do me a favor and stop calling me baby. You can address me as Agent Kensington. We have to leave immediately. We've preserved your private jet just as you left it. It's waiting at Heathrow Airport.

A Chigro?

We don't use the term 'Negro' anymore. It's considered offensive.

I understand that, Mr. Powers, but let me be perfectly clear with you, perhaps to the point of being insulting. I will never have sex with you, ever.  If you were the last man on Earth and I was the last woman on Earth, and the future of the human race depended on our having sex simply for procreation, I still would not have sex with you.

No, actually. I don't know how to put this really. Well, there have been fabulous advances in the field of dentistry.

No worries, luv. We'll just give Basil a tinkle on the telling bone...

Only sailors use condoms, man.

I'll tell him. By the way, I've decided we should keep our relationship strictly professional.

Sadly, no. Hold on! I always keep this on me just in case.

Shut up.

Too right, youth. That's why I need you to lead the troops.

Are you crazy?

Danger's my middle name.

Sure.

Where did you learn to shoot?

In many ways, Bob's Big Boy never left, sir. He's always offered the same high quality meals at competitive prices.

Should we scramble TacHQ for an intercept?

My son?

They're mutated sea bass.

Please allow me to demonstrate.

Evil, actually, Doctor Evil.

We've heard from Scott, now let's hear from you.

Not me.

Well, me and a buddy went to the video arcade in town and, like, they don't speak English right, and so my buddy gets into a fight, and he goes 'hey, quit hassling me cause I don't speak French or whatever', and the other guy goes something in Paris talk, and I go 'um, just back off' and he goes 'get out' and I go 'make me'.

Why don't you just shoot him now? Here, I'll get a gun. We'll just shoot him. Bang! Dead. Done.

All right then...  ...FIVE MILLION DOLLARS!

Just wait. Once Austin gets you in his charms, it's impossible to get out.

Of course not. I was married to your father.

I'm on with a friend!  Look, I'd better go. I love you.

No, he's really evil.

Sir August Merryweather? I was looking for something relaxing. Say, a Tuscan hillside in June?

Seriously?

Black...

Love...

... love ...

So I'm still ...

Out in India. So character-forming for the British. Not the heat. Good Lord, no. The rain, dash it. A good monsoon. Fifteen inches overnight. A whole week of lovely rain. I remember one summer in Jaipur ...

Mr. John Steed, please.

Eh? In here!

This isn't a game.

Ropes?

You're mad.

Really?  I fail to see the connection.

Ahh. Perfect fit. The luxury of a hand-made shoe. As unique as a face or a fingerprint. Or should I say DNA?

After our fencing match, I was rather hoping you would do the risking. More tea?

An eccentric recluse?

Thanks ...  I see what you mean about letting me do the risking ... Hello?

Filling in mother nature's blind spots ... ?

According to Dr. Darling, you're a psychopathic personality with schizophrenic delusions, suffering from recurring amnesia based on traumatic repression, leading to outbursts of anti-social and violent behavior.  Q.E.D.

Have I trespassed on a male prerogative?  We're being followed. I saw him at Trubshaw's ...

Barely.

Nothing personal.

Winning isn't everything.

It's called Black Leather.

You needn't bother. I can't drag you further into this. After all, I am still the chief suspect.

But --

What kept you?

'... in a beautiful pea green boat...'

Pity your mother came, too ...

You're saying I have no choice.

Decontamination -- ?

I see.

Well, I can't possibly go like this.

I'm going to find out who killed my husband. Will you take these documents to Steed?

Global warming?

So you say ...

Brenda and I thought we'd drop in.

You didn't come to talk about the weather, surely.

Who knows? If Dr. Darling is right, you should watch out.

Too late anyway. Today's escapade was only for starters. This is no ordinary weather. It's manmade. A kind of weather bomb.

Her husband suspected someone very close to the operation. On the day he died, he was setting a test. To prove to himself -- to us that his wife was beyond suspicion. He had to be certain. He said he was going to give Mrs. Peel something ...

Guilty until proven innocent?

That's not playing by the rules.

Women!

Not interested.

Ooh, be still, my heart.

Cole, when was the last time you had a lobotomy?

Sure have...

But how can I do that?

Well, tell the asshole to shut up.

Finally realized Rick's a jerk, huh?

Cole, I'm sorry, I...

But a fabulous cook.

Want to hear something great? Bobbie and Phoebe are throwing me a shower. It's really gonna be fun.

I'm not talking about does. I'm talking about hookers.

You better not have too much joy.

Anything you say, ma'am. Have a fun shower. Use soap.

You don't believe me? Okay, fine.

Let's get naked.

I know what I'm doing... Go!

Quiet, Mother.

Let's see your bread.

All right, gentlemen, I'm not gonna sugar-coat this thing. I've known you guys since grade school, so I'm gonna give it to you straight from the hip... right from the shoulder... without beating around the bush... Nothing fancy, just the plain, hard facts... tell it like it is.

Rick, I really think I'm in love.

I want women.

I need them for a bachelor party at the Park View Hotel.

Larry, you and your wife got problems?

That's it.

Yeah, I guess so.

It's Bullwinkle.

This is the Park View Hotel. I'm the Hotel Manager. Are you looking for someone?

I see what you mean... You're a beautiful guy. And you're doing a damn good job.

Your attention, please. May I be the first to say, It's a raid!

Let me finish. Debbie's an adult. She can do what she wants. But if you want your marriage to last, you're going to have to change some things about yourself. If I may make some suggestions...

First, you're a slob. You have to dress for success. Second, your outlook on life...

No sob story is going to change my mind.

The phone made me do it!

Klupner.  Mrs. Klupner.

I'm separated.

She probably had sex scheduled for 12:30. O'Neill, let's pick up the guys for a drink... I have major news to announce.

Nothing... Let's get crazy!

This isn't right.

So long, Father.

About what?

Get a few drinks into me, we'll dance and see what happens.

And here's Mike's partner, in more ways than one. A gal who doesn't think happiness ends with primates. The very lovely, Miss Desiree...

Thanks, Stan, you've been a lot of help.

You're absolutely right. I should never have stopped to save that drowning infant. I'm just weak, Sister; I'm so weak.

Get going, Rick... you're late enough as it is.

I don't know.

No, we'll hit the son of a bitch head on.

Nah, listen to it. It's a pussy. It'll just steam on us. It won't flash. Go high in the ceiling.

-- What the fuck were you thinking, huh? Burning people? You're a fireman.

That was an accident! Jesus Christ, why did you have to go in there so fucking early? Why didn't you listen to me!

It works.

Thanks for the speakers.

I'm in heaven, Lt.

-- C'mon, Stephen.

-- I told you to stay next to me!

This?

Dad's way? Where did he tell you that? In a fucking seance?

Just leave me alone, okay?

Carrying Swayzak's notebook?

...Okay. I'll arrange things with your assignment captain.  Marty's a good man, Brian.

Green committed to a thousand.  There's another fund-raising party tonight. Marty'd really like you to come.

Boy, Rimgale's as slow as a snail, isn't he?

Got anything to drink in there?

Homey.

Uh huh.

-- Bullshit! You knew what I told you wasn't ready for the papers --

Leave Stephen out of this --

Hi.

It's a small town.

So you came to me...  Well, this is going to be an interesting afternoon after all...

What?

-- I wanted to be him. Right then I wanted to be him more than anything...

The outlets.

Not such a far walk after all, is it, Brian?

You walked out on this academy six years ago. One week to graduation. You think we forgot that? You think I did?

-- I don't give a damn what your test scores were, maybe you could have been a good firemen, but you had your shot.

Even if you graduate this academy, you've still got nine months of probation. That's hard duty, son. If you don't really love this job, it'll kill you.

Pest control.

That's why the sealant on the doors... So what have we got, a torch with a conscience?

Fire.

Who all ended up wearing candles for faces...  Swayzak's up to his ass in this somehow. Guy can barely hold a drink in his hand, he's so scared.

It had to be someone who knows numbers. Some kind of fancy accountant. But what's the connection?

Four months.

Stephen told him you were killed in a hot tub accident.

Stephen's not staying here now, Brian. He moved out last April.

Brian, let me come to the point. I'd like to offer you a job.

Not every job in the fire department comes with a tombstone, Brian. This could be a great opportunity to move... beyond a fire engine.

And DIE!

The great communicator.

Coffee? Nah, I gotta go.

Y'know, I treated him better than any other probie I ever had. He probably hates my guts, but I did the best thing for him. I made him finally look in the mirror.

Absolutely.

And the world -- the whole world.

Are the glory boys actually showing interest in Investigation's work? I may have a stroke.

What do you listen to, Stephen?

I need that report, Lt.

No Marty, I don't.

Didya ever think of moving to a cheaper apartment? $3,500 a month is crazy, man!

Yes.

What the fuck are you? A drug counselor or a drug dealer? And you don't even do your own product! What kind of businessman are you?

Why do I dream every night of the whore who brought you water on your road to death? And why have I never forgotten that if she, then I --

What about the money you owe me on yesterday's game?

All right. What are you gonna do?

That's my problem. Just put in my bet.

You've really got a problem.

I think of running for help, and falling to my knees in prayer.

Yo Black, you looking for trouble.

YEAH!

Give me some?

Hook you up?  The Mau-Mau's?  You must be smoking.  Why in the world would I want to hook up a bunch of red, black and green flag-waving pseudo revolutionairies?

Microphone check.  One.  Two.  One. Two.  One.  Two.  Hold up.  I gots to give my peeps some props. Brothers introduce yourself.

Microphone check, one, two.  One, two.  Yo Tavis, I be lovin' yo show but Mantan you is foul.  Why you perpetrating?  You a sellout.

She's also moorish.

Sloan never told us she had friends like you.

Meaning?

Good.  I've got a broken back from carrying you all these years anyway.

And I'm the feet.

Some tap dancing, some singing.

I understand.  But again, in all honesty I was not informed.

I've never been given a fair shot.

I'm an oreo, a sell out?  Because I don't aspire to do HOMEBOYS FROM OUT OF SPACE, SECRET DIARY OF DESMOND PFEIFFER, A PJ's or some as you might put it, some "nigger" show?  I'm a Tom?  I'm whiter than white and you're blacker than black? Is that what you think?

Go on.  Good so far.

So let's take this great form, this very American tradition of entertainment into the 21st century, into the new millennium.

What are there character traits?

In the projects.  Like Eddie Murphy's "The PJ's."

To hire someone solely on their ethnicity, gender or religion is not right.  It's un-American.  I will hire someone who is most qualified for this particular job.

No!!!  Just meet the guy.  That's all I'm asking.  Look, I'll even let you choose your own musical director.  You can have that.

I thought you had promised Mommy you stopped.

The same old, same old.  Trying to get my stuff through.

I didn't mean that, in life.

I was a hostess at this club, your Daddy was performing and I had never laughed so hard in my life. He asked me to come with him.  I quit my job and we've been together ever since.

Manray!

Dunwitty wants a Coon show.  And that's what I'm going to give him, it's going to be so racist, so negative, he won't have the balls to put it on the air.  Hence I'll prove my point.

I feel like somebody hit me upside da head with a sledgehammer.

What's the chances of MANTAN being picked up?

Hello.

Break a leg.

Let's leave the man in peace so he can get ready.

The pleasure is mine.

I'm sorry, I can't help it.  It's too funny.

Everybody shut up.

This is authentic, not a repro, circa turn of the century.

To me, it shows part of our history in this country, a time when we were considered inferior, sub-human.

Light?

You can talk all that mumbo jumbo if you want to but your hands are much bloody.  I know where I made my big mistake.  I have a general rule, never get involved romantically with somebody crazier than you.

Give me the gun.

He, I'm Mona.

Same thing Giuliani said.

Hope the same thing doesn't happen to me.  That's some big shoes to fill.

What you did is dead wrong.

I'll be right over.

I can't go all the way down south.

C'mon, Mommy.  Daddy hasn't been impressed with anything I've ever done.  From winning my fifth grade Spelling Bee to the present.

Yes I have, very hard.  Has Daddy called?

If and when he calls, please don't forget to ask him if he's seen Mantan.

Did you just ask me what's a Negro? I'M A NEGRO!!!

My visual style is very erotic, sexy, how do you say - hot?

This show was created, conceived by you, a non-threatening African- American male.  Voila.  End of argument.  It can't be racist because you're black.

You've never had any formal training, either?

What do you mean?

I'm sure that was the only thing he was impressed with.  You look beautiful like that.

I think that would probably make you the happiest.  When I'm hoofing, I mean really doing my thing, hitting it, nothing compares to that feeling in the world.

Yo, Tavis, check it out.  This is the two-one, the 21st century and it's all about the money.  Like my man Mase says, "it's all about the Benjamins."

No if you go with the flow, Tavis. That's what a lot of Negroes don't understand.  Protesting isn't gonna do a damn thing.  If people don't like our satire in our number one hit show then don't watch it.  Or better yet write your own show.  Do it better.

...the big apple, New York, New York.

Our Alabamy Home.  Now we're getting countrified.  We is Bama's.

The one with da big...

She hates dem.

...to big.  The in-between one, not too tight, not too lose.

I'll buy her a less expensive dress, so I can have some money left over to take her out to dinner.

No.  That's her second cousin. Who's married to Li'l Bit.

...no, she didn't...

Enough.

Gots no intention of ending up broke.

For what?  He left.  Not me.

My people love me.

After my internship expired, Dela was impressed and offered me a position as his assistant.

Just ask me what you want to know.

That's ancient history.  That has nothing to do with you and I.

Forget about me, are you a puppet for DeLa?

That is none of your business.

I'm not afraid of highwaymen.  My man is armed, and so am I.

It's not the English way, for ladies to have two lovers, and, so, Mr. Dugan, I'll thank you to pay me the sum you owe me, and I resign all claims to this young lady.  If she has a fancy for school-boys, let her take 'em, sir.

I never was more in earnest.

It's a lie!  You're a deserter! You're an impostor, sir; Your lies and folly have confirmed this to me. You pretend to carry dispatches to a general who has been dead these ten months; you have an uncle who is an ambassador and whose name you don't know.  Will you join and take the bounty, sir, or will you be given up?

The man that marries Dorothy Dugan must first kill me -- do you mind that?

He'll give the better mark.  I am not afraid of him.

Your cousins go out with him.

Mrs. John Best!  Was there another Mr. John Best?!

The coward!

Ah -- I see.  No, I'm afraid mine are the O'Higgins of Watertown.

Your Grace owes me seventy thousand frederics, which I have honorably won.

Your honor must lower his voice.

Only the agency of servants.

How can I believe that there is not a man who has inspired desires in you?

Then you have never loved?  Your heart is empty.

Then I will respectfully take leave of her.

I'd draw my sword, and cut my way through them.

Well, then, I'll tell you what I'd do.  I'd jump Daisy into the river, and swim you both across, where no enemy could follow us.

Indeed, Miss Dorothy, I intend to have his blood as sure as my name's Roderick.

Do you happen to know Gustavus Adolphus, the thirteenth Earl of Crabs?

When is he to go?

What is to be done?

Everything -- my purse, containing upwards of a hundred guineas, my jewels, my snuff-boxes, watches. And all because this blundering coward fell to his knees...

I see.

Yes?

What the devil?  What kind of fools do we have here?  Pottle, who told the lad this story?

Would you have me spend my life all alone?

Black-eyed Sczortarska.

You know that was like a quadruple negative?

What do we do?

What do you mean, alone?

We found him like this...

We can still come out of this okay. Pike got free, he got a gun, he came after us. That's the story.

C'mon, Ray, everyone hates the Army during Basic. I'll tell you straight, I hated it here.

Fifteen years ago under Sergeant West. Piece of work, that guy. I remember, he used to have these two silver .45's with ivory handles and if you weren't quick enough, he'd knock you on the head with one of them. He still carry those guns?

They're dead, aren't they?

I'm not telling you what happened.

You saw West's body.

No, ma'am, he just wanted us to quit. Making it through was kind of an honor. Some of the other guys on the base told us that if you could hack Section Eight, Command would consider you at the top of the class.

Tell us about the other guys, the ones West weeded out.

Sir, yes, sir!

Why?

West... he's dead.

So did we. Why didn't you come?

Yeah...

Oh, come on --

From up close or far away?

They?

Put it down!

Coast Guard, special detective detail. We feel this incident may have put the beaches of Florida at risk.

Levi, you got about four hours before armed men show up here, put you on a plane to Washington, and lock you in a very small dark room. I suggest you talk to us.

You said you wanted to know what happened -- I'm telling you the truth.

I didn't kill him --

Mr. Hardy?

So I should stay silent about his misdeeds? The guns went off, I ran in, Childs shot me, Pike and Mueller were dead, and Dunbar was running out the door with the smoking gun --

Then we'll leave it up to the courts -- His word against mine. What does his father do again? Steelworker?  Doesn't matter, I'm sure justice will be served. In any case, my father will definitely want to talk to you about all these questions, these accusations on his son. He's quite protective.

Maybe --

Maybe he...

Would I have called you if it wasn't? If there was any other way --

It's not West, is it? Tell me it's not West.

Well, he's a good soldier.

The Senator...

Senator Jonathan Kendall, of Ohio.

Kendall Junior is still in surgery, so he won't be available to answer for his name or anything else for another hour -- the cadet we're talking to first is Dunbar.

Excuse me?

That is the most unprofessional --

Good cop/bad cop?

Ten bucks says I have him talking in under three minutes.

You had a mobile of bayonets above your crib.

Yeah. That's just the story I tell the girls to get them into bed. Truth is... I don't know. The whole honor and duty thing. Make a difference in the world, crap like that. Didn't really work out.

The very same.

So noted.

Imagine what it must have been like for them out there. What do you think of Dunbar?

Oh, spare me the reverse psychology bullshit! This isn't my "great second chance", Osborne. Everyone thinks I'm a piece of shit cop who took money and nothing is going to change that. Nobody will ever know what happens here --

Exactly, someone who's not involved, who's word can't be questioned. You only let them see what you want them to see, you make them believe, so when the time comes, they've totally bought into your version of events.

Kendall maybe would have agreed, but the hurricane buttfucks the cabin --

Think it'll work?

What are you talking about?

Poor fucker my ass...

What, "The Truth"? Please. There are degrees of truth, officer, always degrees. Things are not what they seem.

He wanted more than that.

Like I said, I was in the kitchen. When I came out, Mueller and Pike were dead, Nunez and Childs were hit and Dunbar was gone.

No, but it got you interested, didn't it? Got you to dig. Inspired Ray to tell you terribly sordid tales about drugs and creek beds and dead little sergeants who stuck their noses where they didn't belong.

Then he's mistaken. You know, I really don't think my father would approve of this line of questioning --

What the fuck are you doing?

Yeah.

Ma'am, Ray Dunbar's black.

Then it's unofficial.

He tried to burn Dunbar to us. You don't do that if you're not involved.

Sir, yes, sir!

I'm going to spend the rest of my life looking for her. That or die alone.

Sorry, kid. I don't do charity.

Not yet.

He's still here. Let me buy you a drink. I'll tell you all about it. Hell, I'll have him tell you.

I'll go in right now and get that eye.

I didn't know she belonged to anybody.

Dr. Bennett. It's good to see you.  My wife, Josephine.

You're pretty good at arithmetic.

How did you know?

Then I don't think so Mr. Bloom. If nothing is going to change, I'd just as soon it not change in the way it hasn't been changing all this time.

I was 18. He was 28. Turns out that was a big difference.

I can get it. I can just...

Please. Go. Just go.

I was dreaming.

Oh, so this is a tall tale?

Really?

What's your name, Giant?

Beats me.

I am a footnote in that story. I am the context for your great adventure. Which never happened! Incidentally! You were selling novelty products in Wichita the day I was born.

Your mom says I can't tell you that one anymore. You get nightmares.

Did you do any of that?

The Old Lady by the swamp.

So how does it happen?

Really.

Like this.

Yes. Exactly.

I have the rest of my life to find out.

Go out with me.

There is no softer ground than town.

Norther, do you ever regret not making it to Paris?

You're a poet. You oughta be able to. And maybe if you'd seen more, you could.

I was astonished to see the greatest poet of both Ashton and Spectre all the way out in Texas.

Hello.

Because he's dying.

You don't have to.

Did you?

They met at Auburn.

But it's not true.

You're not.

But I understand you, Mom. I always have.

No I don't.

I've been buying you stuff all week. I've been buying him stuff all week.

Those aren't presents. That's normal friendship stuff

Yeah. It was quite good actually. Some bits I really liked.

You heard what I said. I'm pregnant. I've been throwing up for weeks.

Ch...

Uh... Yes.

Hang on hang on, sorry, but like, who are you?

Good. 

Of course not. Alexei, he's is my problem.

Binoculars. He had these Binoculars he has kept from the war.

Good night.

What? What does he want?

I'll fuckin' give it to him! We'll go down there.

I've got eight hundred pounds. Oh Jesus.

Yes.

Yes.

No I don't.

So you're just going to be vindictive

It's none of your business.

Look, if you want to know is he better in bed than you then yes he is.

If what you want to know is does he have a bigger cock than you, then yes he does.

He left me my passport and ticket. It's pretty clear he wants to see me again.

No. But you tend to tie them up.

You don't want to talk about it.

Oh. I think you will recover okay. I think you got what you paid for.

Get out

Get out.

You don't have to say anything

Yeah. He's a smashing bloke.

Well what have you got?

No.

What?

Okay. Promise?

I'm sorry.

I already tossed that out.  Somethin' you should'a done to that woman long ago... how she treated you. Of course, that's none of my business.

Well that's good. I'm happy to hear it.

I need ya help again.

I do. God's truth. I do.

You seen my snake-skin shoes?

Can I put it in your mouth?

Yeah. Transmission's shot.

Now wait...

You think I'm Ronnie's spy or somethin'? Come tomorrow that dumb- ass gonna be halfway round the world tryin' to keep his head on his shoulders. You think he's gonna be thinkin' about you?

It's so stupid. Says to me that he don't want nothin' to do with no military career. Says he wants to move. Open up an auto shop with his uncle up in Knoxville. I said, okay. How about now? Let's go.

Can't be thinkin' bout him every second of my day. I'll go outta my gourd.

Your mother's funeral. I's a pallbearer, remember?

If you come to talk about that muthafucka, I'm gonna get up and leave you sittin' pretty in that new suit he bought'cha.

And you gonna live it with him?

Let go...

Boy? You here to make a point, or you here to kill somebody?

Tehronne? Tehronne done this?

GAL! YOU HEARIN' MY VOICE?

Come on, gal...

Why you got me chained?

What do you want?

No ma'am.

Or what?

I CAN'T!

Uh-uh.

I don't fuckin' cook.

You drink whiskey?

You just havin' a fit. You ain't goin' nowhere.

Right here. Be here all afternoon.  You ready for this?

You know how you feel when you come out of a bad hangover? Like your eyes can open a little bit more.

What I love.

This Rae... you get with her?

Why you say that?

She like it rough? You like beatin' on her?

What'chu sayin'?

Don't know if God wanna see me.

I'm tellin' you the truth, dammit. I found her beat. Left for dead. So I brung her home.

Ask the chef.

We ain't here to talk about that shit.

I gotta ask you. Why do you think Laz is keepin' you chained like this?

You could put it that way.

Are you wasted?

Yeah, I do.

Got in a little accident.

You never needed nobody. Always made that clear to me.

-- Cavello.  Ronnie Cavello.

Maybe Cavello's buying a Subaru. How would I know?

Saving your life.

Nick, we can't just --

Pussy, ass, soft personnel.

What'd she say?

Yeah... I came to save you.  If you're hopeless, I'll pull the plug.

I wasn't expecting you.

Why weren't you at the platform?

I stole them.

He says they're very nice.  He wants to know if you have anymore.

You toler -- yes, tolerate me.

Smells like Bayonne at low tide.

You were too far behind.

Let's go.  Him first.

Luck.

Yes...

Joyce, give the assistant Chief Inspector a drink, would you?

Gaiijin?

I could use some help.  Show me around.  I'll pay you for your time.

Sure, but then I just pull out the photos.

It's my last shot.  I have to be on a plane home tomorrow night.

Not if it works.  I'll meet you at the train?

Who am I supposed to be?

No one's keeping him here.

Last time you asked me to come along I nearly got a hole in my head.

Guess I'm on a roll.

Incompetent is letting people waltz through a secure area wearing your uniforms, carrying official documents.

It is not allowed.

Twenty-four hours, detective.

Here's your check, my boy.  Thank you.

It's not an easy thing to meet your maker.

Can the maker repair what he makes?

Death.

If it wouldn't be too much of a bother... a little bite to eat would be...

Like what?

Dr. Tyrell?

Thank you.

Very good, Pris.  Now show him why.

Okay, but don't kill him.  Save a little for everybody.  A masterpiece.

Garbage man?

If you hurry you'll get back before it gets cold.  I got a spinner on your roof in five minutes.  Good luck.

Then let her get away.  I thought you were a pro -- you're supposed to be a fuckin' tracker!

Yeah.

She's not with you?

I know all that.

I think we're through for the night.

Never mind.  Do they have that knowledge?

I don't know.

Four years.

Yeah.  But that's what I wanted to talk to you about.

I think I'm starting to empathize with these Nexus-sixes.

Huh huh.

True.

They'll change the limit before I change my mind.

Never been more sure of anything in my life.

Too old.

The girl that doesn't look like that girl.

What's suck night?

Oh, yeah. You'd be surprised what goes on around here.  I'd like to check the dressing room if I could.

Of course he's not real.  You think I'd be working here if I could afford a real snake?

I bet I would.

You're watching T.V. and suddenly you notice a wasp crawling on your wrist.

I'd never get an abortion.

That would be murder, Mr. Deckard.

Ugh.

Can you?  I couldn't.

You did?

Yeah.  Sometimes.

It wasn't very good last night, was it?

I don't like the noise.  Just practice.  Practice makes perfect.

What difference will it make?

Black?

Nothing is infallible, but so far the Voight-Kampff scale bas been foolproof.

Discreetly.

Sorry.

How do you know I'm not?

Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay attention.  Answer quickly as you can.

I never seen a turtle.

You reach down and flip the tortoise over on its back, Leon.

Hi.

I've got stuff.  If you wanna go to my place?

Just better.

Thanks.

You like it?

No, I'm not! My mom taught me.

What?!

Well, your business must not be sports memorabilia, because this one Mantle card right here--  --is worth six thousand dollars all by its little self.

No, you get out of here.

I just had a mental picture of...

Oh, that's nice.

See? I'm psychic. Not completely, but pretty much. That was pretty good, wasn't it?!

Well, that changes everything. Get the fuck away from me!!  I mean it!!

Oh, I could die...

I know a short-cut.

Yeah, same here. Don't forget your suitcase.

Why does it never work out?  You and...men?

What's the pay?

I've got to make at least a thousand a week.

Sure.

They like Dr. Pepper.

No problem.  We'll just sell another baseball card.

Okay.

Think of me as your genie.  Just ask.

The big one!

I wouldn't know.  What kind of wife are you looking for?

Two weeks.

You said it would be easy!

I like it.

He's a former boyfriend. We lived together for about six months.  And yes, I'll admit it.  I've still kind of got a thing for him.  That's what you wanted to know, isn't it?

Um-hum.

No.  We keep it in the backyard.  Of course, in the house.  It's in there.

Okay. All right.  And what do I say?

I'm sorry.

Eve, I'm sorry.

What in the hell are you doing here!! You're supposed to be over on San Vicente Boulevard having unsafe sex with that slut Sophie!!

Well, you had better!!

...All right, Eve.  If you say so.

Could I please just go home?  I was lost, but this morning I found home and I promise not to bother any of you ever again.

The front door is open.  Will you be back?

No, son. A pitcher.

Your mom made that all by herself.

Merci!

Yeah.

The recovery? Oh , yeah! Hey, they rebuilt the freeway in six months.

No!  There's an Adult Bookstore back there!  I'll be right back!

How 'bout we check with Eve first?

So, did you buy a movie?

A magazine?  A toy perhaps?  In the bookstore.

Goodbye.

Bye, Adam!

Thirty-five.

Oh, my holy stars! A Negro!

I see what ya mean. Tell you what...I'll give you five hundred dollars in small bills for the whole box.

Well, we're here to help!

Oh, you got a problem with that?

I'll be all right.

What?

And now you must let me be the judge of that!

Cute Little Old Man, if you want a boy, I can be a boy.  And if you want a girl, I can be a girl.  I can be anything you want me to be!

Uh-huh. And it's all yours for the remarkably low price of only $200! And if you act now, I might even throw in some free lawn furniture.

We'll do this again! Maybe next week. Here's your hat. Could I wrap something up for you? Did you have a coat?

Worse than your Kraft Holiday dip?

Rather safe than sorry. That's my motto!

To you maybe.

No, Calvin, you're favorite.

I told you! I've got everything!

What?

And I was wondering...if...if I could have a...

Oh, I was just examining this rear hatchway.

Oh my. Oh,my, oh my, oh, my. So, what do we do now?

We'll make do.  I'm of the opinion that these mutants will eventually kill each other off and then--

I thought ten years.

Shana Gillroy's apartment.  Remember her?  The model who went to Harvard? Well, I better get going!  Bye, Adam. Nice coat!

Oh, yes.

Oh, my God...

Exactly.  You understand that, don't you?  You have no chance of meeting a woman dressed like that.

Money is no object.  He's got cards up the wazoo.

Adam,  I think for you, we should go for "sweet."

It's not so much what you say but how you say it.  Women like men who are unpredictable.

Those sluts!

From the oddest place. His parent's told him. I don't think I got that memo.

He left with Sophie.

I know...I know. You did the right thing.

Oh.  Well, you're...certainly welcome!

Fallout shelter.

I don't know.  Everything's so neat. It's all just so...goddamn dear.  Damn!

Say your problem, Wolf One. Are you declaring an emergency?

Sometimes it helps to talk things over. For instance, many marriages are saved by.

Yes?

Yes I have - so bad I wouldn't poison your mind by telling you.

Yeah.

Okay, I gotta tell you. I've discovered some things. Anyway I have to show you some pictures and tell you some things about them. The first picture is this.

I have no hard proof of any of this. Her address is also on the photos. I think these people are involved with drugs, and murder. I think Frank is killing drug dealers and...  ...and somehow Frank is getting all their drugs. I had to tell you I got slightly more involved in this than you wanted me to, but it's over now for sure. I had to tell you about these things in case it could help.

Yes sir.

Jeffrey.

I was an experiment. Just to see if I could do it.

No. Come on.

Look. I'm sorry. Just let me leave.

I, I don't know.

See my nipples?

What?

Go then. I can't let you put it in me now but I want you. I like you.

Frank? Can you stand up?

Why are you so interested? Why do you keep asking me?

Or do you just want me? I'm going to let you enter me now.

Sure I do.

Whatiya mean?

Beeeee careful.

Sometimes I think I do.

You put your disease in me. Your semen. It's hot and full of disease.

I did. Are you?

I want you to stay with me.

I promise, Dorothy. I promise.

You want to see him too, right?

If you want to.

Yeah. I guess I did.  What's going to happen to me?

Speak to me Fucker.

No thanks. What does that mean?

What?

Right here Frank. You want me to pour it?

There ya go.

This is it.

Be right down.

Of course, Jeffrey.

Is something wrong? What's happened to your face?

I mean, you don't exactly have the build for a football. I mean, no offense.

I mean, some guys play anyway but they usually get slaughtered.

You were pretty popular. Didn't you run for some office?

Terrible boring.

I don't know, like I said, she's not my father's case.

Settle down. I have a plan which I think will work. There is very little for you to do, but I do need your help. Aren't you curious about my plan?

Alright. Good luck, yourself.

I didn't get a good look at him either, but he sure looked at me. I didn't have time to get a window, but I found this key.  Pretty nifty, huh?
