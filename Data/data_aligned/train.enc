Can we make this quick?  Roxanne Korrine and Andrew Barrett are having an incredibly horrendous public break- up on the quad.  Again.

Not the hacking and gagging and spitting part.  Please.

You're asking me out.  That's so cute. What's your name again?

No, no, it's my fault -- we didn't have a proper introduction ---

The thing is, Cameron -- I'm at the mercy of a particularly hideous breed of loser.  My sister.  I can't date until she does.

Why?

Gosh, if only we could find Kat a boyfriend...

C'esc ma tete. This is my head

I don't want to know how to say that though.  I want to know useful things. Like where the good stores are.  How much does champagne cost?  Stuff like Chat.  I have never in my life had to point out my head to someone.

There.

You got something on your mind?

How do you get your hair to look like that?

She's not a...

Hi.

Have fun tonight?

Well, no...

But

Then Guillermo says, "If you go any lighter, you're gonna look like an extra on 90210."

do you listen to this crap?

Me.  This endless ...blonde babble. I'm like, boring myself.

The "real you".

I'm kidding.  You know how sometimes you just become this "persona"?  And you don't know how to quit?

She okay?

They do to!

Did you change your hair?

Where did he go?  He was just here.

Great

He practically proposed when he found out we had the same dermatologist. I mean. Dr. Bonchowski is great an all, but he's not exactly relevant party conversation.

Bianca, I don't think the highlights of dating Joey Dorsey are going to include door-opening and coat-holding.

I have to be home in twenty minutes.

You think you ' re the only sophomore at the prom?

Exactly  So, you going to Bogey Lowenbrau's thing on Saturday?

So yeah, I've got the Sears catalog thing going -- and the tube sock gig " that's gonna be huge.  And then I'm up for an ad for Queen Harry next week.

Neat...

Hey, sweet cheeks.

Listen, I want to talk to you about the prom.

Where've you been?

I have the potential to smack the crap out of you if you don't get out of my way.

Oh my God, does this mean you're becoming normal?

Oh, I thought you might have a date  I don't know why I'm bothering to ask, but are you going to Bogey Lowenstein's party Saturday night?

You're ruining my life'  Because you won't be normal, I can't be normal.

Can't you forget for just one night that you're completely wretched?

Like I'm supposed to know what that even means.

You are so completely unbalanced.

Bianca, I need to talk to you -- I need to tell you --

I don't get you.  You act like you're too good for any of this, and then you go totally apeshit when you get here.

Listen, I know you hate having to sit home because I'm not Susie High School.

I do care. But I'm a firm believer in doing something for your own reasons, not someone else ' s .

Joey never told you we went out, did he?

In 9th.  For a month

He was, like, a total babe

Now I do.  Back then, was a different story.

He said everyone was doing it.  So I did it.

But

Why didn't you tell me?

That's not

I guess I thought I was protecting you.

Not all experiences are good, Bianca. You can't always trust the people you want to.

You looked beautiful last night, you know.

Let go!

I just wanted --

Patrick -- is that- a.

Now don't get upset. Daddy, but there's this boy... and I think he might ask...

What if she never starts dating?

But she doesn't want to date.

Daddy, I --

If you must know, we were attempting to go to a small study group of friends.

Daddy, people expect me to be there!

Oh, God.  It's starting.

Wear the belly before you go.

Promise me you won't talk to any boys unless your sister is present.

I'm missing something.

Always a pleasure, Brucie.

Padua girls.  One tall, decent body. The other one kinda short and undersexed?

You the new guy?

So -- which Dakota you from?

I was kidding. People actually live there?

How many people were in your old school?

Get out!

That girl -- I --

Why not?

Why do girls like that always like guys like that?

He always have that shit-eating grin?

You know French?

Guess who just signed up for a tutor?

Yeah, just a minor encounter with the shrew.

What about him?

What makes you think he'll do it?

No kidding.  He's a criminal.  I heard he lit a state trooper on fire.  He just got out of Alcatraz...

I'm serious, man, he's whacked.  He sold his own liver on the black market so he could buy new speakers.

Did she actually say she'd go out with you?

You know, if you do go out with Bianca, you'd be set.  You'd outrank everyone. Strictly A-list.  With me by your side.

You got him involved?

This is it.  A golden opportunity. Patrick can ask Katarina to the party.

Number one.  She hates smokers

Her favorite uncle

He's pretty!

Buttholus extremus.  But hey, you're making progress.

You humiliated the woman! Sacrifice yourself on the altar of dignity and even the score.

Okay -- Likes:  Thai food, feminist prose, and "angry, stinky girl music of the indie-rock persuasion".

Gigglepuss is playing there tomorrow night.

Cameron, I'm a little busy

What 're you talking about?

What'd you do to her?

She hates you with the fire of a thousand suns .  That's a direct quote

You makin' any headway?

What's the worst?

The vintage look is over, Kat. Haven't you been reading your Sassy?

Hey -- do you mind?

Where ya goin?

Leave my sister alone.

Yeah

Two legs, nice rack...

Sure, Sparky.  I'll get right on it.

You need money to take a girl out

You got it, Verona.  I pick up the tab, you do the honors.

I can't date her sister until that one gets a boyfriend.  And that's the catch. She doesn't want a boyfriend.

I can't take a girl like that out on twenty bucks.

Take it or leave it.  This isn't a negotiation.

When I shell out fifty, I expect results.

Watching the bitch trash my car doesn't count as a date.

I just upped my price

It's about time.

How'd you do it?

I don't know, Dorsey. ..the limo.-the flowers.  Another hundred for the tux --

Hey.

Nope - just came by to chat

Well, actually, I thought I'd run an idea by you.  You know, just to see if you're interested.

I hear you're helpin' Verona.

You better not fuck this up.  I'm heavily invested.

Who's that?

That's Pat Verona? The one who was gone for a year? I heard he was doing porn movies.

He always look so

Mandella, eat.  Starving yourself is a very slow way to die.

What's this?

I realize that the men of this fine institution are severely lacking, but killing yourself so you can be with William Shakespeare is beyond the scope of normal teenage obsessions.  You're venturing far past daytime talk show fodder and entering the world of those who need very expensive therapy.

So he has this huge raging fit about Sarah Lawrence and insists that I go to his male-dominated, puking frat boy, number one golf team school. I have no say at all.

William didn't even go to high school

I appreciate your efforts toward a speedy death, but I'm consuming.  Do you mind?

You think this'll work?

What'd he say?

You went to the party?  I thought we were officially opposed to suburban social activity.

You didn't have a choice?  Where's Kat and what have you done with her?

You didn't

Can you even imagine?  Who the hell would go to this a bastion of commercial excess?

Listen to you!  You sound like Betty, all pissed off because Archie is taking Veronica.

You ' re looking at this from the wrong perspective.  We're making a statement.

Have you seen him?

I mean Wo-man.  How ya doin'?

There's a way to get a guy's attention.

Pick you up Friday, then

The night I take you to places you've never been before.  And back.

Are you following me?

You're not a big talker, are you?

hey.  Great show, huh?

You know, these guys are no Bikini Kill or The Raincoats, but they're right up there.

What's this?

I say, do what you wanna do.

Okay?

You're not okay.

Uh, uh. You lie down and you'll go to sleep

This is so patronizing.

Why 're you doing this?

You don't care if I die

Why?

Like you could find one

Why'd you let him get to you?

Dorsey.

I thought you were above all that

Kat! Wake up!

And I'm in control of it.

When you were gone last year -- where were you?

Were you in jail?

No, you weren't

I should do this.

Start a band?

So what ' s up with your dad?  He a pain in the ass?

Excuse me, have you seen The Feminine Mystique?  I lost my copy.

I heard there was a poetry reading.

Unwelcome?  I guess someone still has her panties in a twist.

He left!  I sprung the dickhead and he cruised on me.

I guess I never told you I'm afraid of heights.

Put your right foot there --

You want me to climb up and show you how to get down?

The Partridge Family?

Good call.

So what's your excuse?

Yes

So if you disappoint them from the start, you're covered?

Then you screwed up

State trooper?

The duck?

Tell me something true.

No -- something real.  Something no one else knows.

You're amazingly self-assured. Has anyone ever told you that?

Is that a request or a command?

No.

No, I won't go with you

Create a little drama?  Start a new rumor?  What?

Answer the question, Patrick

How'd you get a tux at the last minute?

It's just something I had.  You know

That ' s completely adorable!

It wasn't like that.

A Fender Strat. You bought this?

Why is my veggie burger the only burnt object on this grill?

Oh, Bianca?  Can you get me my freshman yearbook?

I know.

This from someone whose diary is devoted to favorite grooming tips?

My insurance does not cover PMS

Is this about Sarah Lawrence? You punishing me?

Why can't we agree on this?

I don't understand the allure of dehydrated food.  Is this something I should be hip to?

Well, yes, compared to your other choices of expression this year, today's events are quite mild.  By the way, Bobby Rictor's gonad retrieval operation went quite well, in case you're interested.

Tempestuous?

Hey there.  Tired of breathing?

Cool pictures.  You a fan?

You think?

Macbeth, right?

Kat a fan, too?

Say it

What plan?

I think I speak correctly when I say that Cameron's love is pure.  Purer than say -- Joey Dorsey's.

That's where we can help you.  With Kat.

You two are gonna help me tame the wild beast?

What?!

Are you telling me I'm a -  "non-smoker"?

Ever been to Club Skunk?

So you got cozy with she who stings?

You were right. She's still pissed.

It was a bratwurst.  I was eating lunch.

I don't understand, Patrick.  You haven't done anything asinine this week. Are you not feeling well?

You weren't abused, you aren't stupid, and as far as I can tell, you're only slightly psychotic -- so why is it that you're such a fuck-up?

You're completely demented.

In the microwave.

What's a synonym for throbbing?

Jesus!  Can a man even grab a sandwich before you women start dilating?

Would you rather be ravished by a pirate or a British rear admiral?

They'll dance, they'll kiss, they'll come home.  Let her go.

What do you wanna watch?  We've got crap, crap, crap or crap

Have a great time, honey!

What just happened?

Did I have anything to say about it?

I never seen heat like this!  Not even in Las Minas!

What are you listening to, chicken ass?

He's the devil's child...

We should have seen land.

You say Asia can be found by sailing west?

Senor Colon, an experienced captain such as yourself will understand our concern with the crew.  I am not willing to have on my conscience the loss of men who would have relied upon our judgment.

Your Eminence, there is only one way to settle the matter.  And that is to make the journey.  I am ready to risk my life to prove it possible.

Trade, Your Excellency.  According to Marco Polo, the Kingdom of China is one of the richest of the world. Even the meanest buildings are roofed with gold.

If God intended our proximity to Asia, do you believe he would have waited for you to show it to the world?

Don't you realize your words could be considered heretical?

Asia can be found to the west -- and I will prove it.

The State has some reason to be interested in this man's proposition, Your Eminence...

He is a mercenary!  Did he not already try to convince the King of Portugal of his absurd notions?

It won't be easy to get rid of your prophet now, Don Sanchez.

You can see for yourself.

I could be gone for years.

I haven't given you much of a life.

Are we going to argue?

Perhaps I was never meant to live with a woman...

I'm not asking you to swear to anything.

Beatrix, I want to ask you something.

God... you're so beautiful!  I can't believe no other man has ever taken you away from me...

They took everything...

Can't you stay with us a little?

What is it, now?  Tell me...

May I ask by whom?

Don Alonso de Bobadilla.

My letters of appointment.

Viceroy of the West Indies.

How far from here?

How are you feeling, Fernando?

Father...

What are you listening to?

I want you to tell me everything you remember, Father.  From the beginning.  Everything.

I remind you, Senor Colon, that you are in no position to bargain with me.

They don't see sin in their nakedness.  They live according to nature, in a never ending summer. The islands are covered with trees, filled with blossoms and fruits. And...

You defend yourself admirably...

But we do have a lack of notaries. You should contact my administration.

You seem to have a special talent for making friends.

All I have to do is call the guards.

I am not afraid of you.  You are nothing but a dreamer.

What do you see?

Say not here!  Cuba!

You come!  You speak first!

Chief knows.

Chief says -- how many?

To bring the word of God.

We will work with his people.  We want peace.  Ask the Chief if he understands?

You have to find them, Utapan.  Look what they did!

Utapan, won't you speak to me?  You used to know how to speak to me.

Diego is a bright boy -- a pleasure to teach -- but so serious... Brothers should be raised together, Colon.  Even brothers from different mothers...

How did you manage it?

How can you be so certain?  The Ocean is said to be infinite.

How can you be so certain?

Esdras is a Jew.

Two minutes... and already you're a dead man.  Don't let passion overwhelm you, Colon.

Father Marchena!

You get so carried away when you are being contradicted!

You mustn't give way to despair. You must wait.

If God intends you to go, then you will go.

Colon!

All of them!  Just lies!

In Nomine Patris et Filius, et Spiritus Sancti.

I am listening, my son.

What are you saying?

How long?

May God forgive you...!  You must tell them!  You must tell your men!

My son, my son...  Your certitudes are sometimes frightening...  Christopher, you must speak to them. And if you don't I will.

I suppose we're both old men now.

I have to disagree.

The ocean is uncrossable?

I cannot ignore the verdict of my council.

May I speak freely?

I know what I see.  I see someone who doesn't accept the world as it is.  Who's not afraid.  I see a women who thinks... "What if?"...

How old are you, Senor Colon?

Do they have such thoughts?

But without your brothers.  Nor are you to return to Santo Domingo or any of the other colonies.  You may explore the continent.

There is one thing I'd like to understand... Why do you want to go back, after all this?

And you say this is an Indian vice? By God!  I don't see any kind of pleasure that would make this a sin.

You want a war?  Fine.  We are a thousand.  They outnumber us by ten! Who will you kill?  Which tribe?

We can't raise the wheel without it.

Don Moxica -- we all have to work.

You'll be held in detention, deprived of your privileges and possessions.  Until you are returned to Spain where you will be judged. Have you anything to say?

Due west, Captain Mendez.  And may God be with us...

Well... It's the men, Sir.  They wonder how you know our position. We've lost sight from land days ago...

Well, I surely know what a quadrant is!  But I've never seen it used at night before.

What's he doing?

You lied!  You cheated!  We're way past 750 leagues!

You must be mad...!

We're lost!

You don't know anything!  Listen Colon, these are my ships, right? So I'm telling you we're turning back!

Jesus Maria!  I should have never listened to you!

You bloody...

You tell that to them!

You were right, Don Sanchez... His demands could never be granted.

... Into a monk...

... But there is worse.  He ordered the execution of five members of the nobility...

Then, what do you suggest, Don Sanchez?

I know, I should not tolerate his impertinence.

Are you my attorney?  I'm Emil.  I'm insane.

Oh no!  No!  Shit!

Don't say anything.

I'm coming with you.

I brought you some letters.  It's really fan mail.  Women mostly.  One wants to buy you clothes, another sent a check. Another wants a check.

...delusions and paranoia.

Well, you didn't appreciate the severity of it until recently.  No question about that.

Disappeared.  They're looking everywhere.  Maybe he went back to Czechoslovakia.

Don't worry about him.  Think about yourself.

Look, I haven't really focused on that kind of thing.

I would say...half.  Half is fair.

But it's...

This is not about money, Emil.  I need your trust in me.

Tell me about yourself.  What you did as a young boy... what your parents were like.

Your mother was blind?

Back in the Czech Republic?

Your father blamed you for your mother's blindness?

That's what he did to me.  He put cigarettes out on me.

Out on my back when I was a small boy.

I'm abused.  Don't you think?

...so we kill someone famous and if we are caught, we are sent to mental hospital...

Now I become custody of police department?

I will if they don't send me back.

Are you married?

The men are out of quarters - practicing putting out fires.

You considered becoming a prostitute?

Did you ever turn tricks before?

What about back home?

I came here.  I had no money.  I knew no one.  I couldn't get a job because you have to have a green card to get work. They approached me - I could've made a lot of money.  I considered it, but... it's not who I am.  They pay me below the table at Ludwig's.

What are you asking me?

I'm not a whore.  I'm not a whore.

You don't know.  I'm sorry.  I was desperate.  That's not me.  I shot a cop.  Can you imagine what they'll do to me when I got to prison?

Are you alright?

Is he your boyfriend?

If I was your boyfriend, I might be.

A good Immigration lawyer could stall the process.  Eddie recommended one.

You better get packed.

I'll make some for us.

What are you doing?

Forget about me.  You have enough problems of your own.

I told your partner, I can't help.  I didn't see anything.

Tamina was a friend of mine.  My shower was broken, she let me use theirs.

Whether you tell us or not, we'll find out.  Better if it comes from you.

Are you here illegally?  Don't worry about that.  We'll talk to Immigration. They won't deport you.

Look, we can help you but right now we have to deal with what's happening here. Tell us the truth...is that the truth?

Oh.

Oh yeah...?  Alright.

Who did cause and origin?

Then why didn't you talk to the reporter?

Hey, Chief, what are you doing here?

Ladder 20 was on the Rock for training. We stopped there... so she could get cleaned up.

I let her take a shower.

No!  Nothing happened.

The public doesn't have any idea what we do and now you're going to define our image!  This is going to be our Rodney King!

Forgot?  You handcuffed a civilian to a tree?!

How are you going to fight this?  Maybe if Oleg hadn't gotten away and you'd been on the front page, as a hero, this thing would be easier to fight.  You'd have the good to weight against the bad! It's unfortunate that I have to make decisions based upon your press coverage but there's nothing I can do!  Gimme your shield.

Don't you guys understand?  It's all about image.  The better we look the more money I get to pay you guys overtime.

What was that, Korfin?

Did the D.A. videotape her deposition?

Coffee for me, I gotta slow down.

It was freaky, I'll tell you.  Stupid kid.

I'm gonna propose.

Tomorrow.  At lunch.

Where is she?

Are you hit?

He got my gun!  Motherfucker was filming the whole time!

Who's there?

I have nothin' to say.  If you wanna contact my attorney...

Yeah.  He wanted a girl from Czechoslovakia, but I sent him Honey 'cause once they get there, you know, it doesn't really matter - Honey was killed...?  Poor girl...

No.

Boy, she's so popular all the sudden.

He said he was her cousin.  I told him where she works.  They were just here.

Hey, that's great you guys got it all wrapped up, but you don't mind if we go through the routine?  It gives us somethin' to do.

You know what that is, right?

It's your crime scene now.  You can do what you want.

Nah, I musta missed it.

Well, just so you know, I don't care about that stuff.

I don't even watch TV.

Did you get a report from the M.E.?

The Super said he'd seen her before but she didn't live here.

Hmmmm.

What would you call her?

Maybe it's a ritual thing or someone trying to send a message.  Burial rites are taken very seriously in Eastern Europe.  It could be to humiliate them. Just burning them up, no proper funeral, it's like condemning them to hell.

I'll come with you.

I can watch you, Eddie.  Maybe I'll learn something.

My parents are from Poland.  I can help with the Eastern European angle.

My folks are.

You goin' to the escort service?

Mind if I ride along with you?

I'll let you know what happens.

Tell you what - I'll flip you a coin. If you win you can come with me.  If you don't win, you don't come.

Two heads.

Leon - meet us at 63rd and Madison. Hair salon.  Ludwig's.

So am I.  Alright, I'll go inside and you cover the back.

Hey!  I always wanted to be a cop when I was a kid.  I dreamed of running up to a door, kicking it in, pulling my gun and yelling 'Freeze!' at the bad guy! What'd you dream about?

What are you hiding?  Why are you afraid

Why not?

Look - let me talk to her.  Any leads I get, they're all yours.  Just let me have a first crack at her.

Yeah.

I'm serious here.

C'mon.  You intimidate her 'cause you're a celebrity.  She sees me differently.

Look, Eddie, I'm tellin' you - I didn't touch her.

I took her there for a shower and that's it.

I told you, you know, I thought I was doing the right thing, you know, I think she's innocent.

But, I mean, didn't you ever go out on a limb for somebody?  I mean, you shoulda heard her there.  Tellin' her whole story...I believed her.

Why'd you help me back there with the Chief?  Why'd you stand up for me like that?

Your opinion.  You see, they going to make a movie about me, too, Eddie.  And write books.

So tabloids don't have to do re enactments.  They going to have real movie this time.

You really think you'll be able to fool a jury with this bullshit?  How fuckin' stupid are you?

Detective, does it look like a murder?

How many victims are up there?

Can we go up to the crime scene?

Is it drug related?

Detective - can you tell us what happened here?

I understand, but I noticed that the Fire Marshall is here with you.  Is this somehow related to the fire department?

Okay.  But I do understand that your partner, Leon Jackson's been injured. Is that correct?

Do you have the suspect in custody?

Eddie, are you okay?

Alright.

What is your problem?  Why'd you snap at me?  I just wanted a statement.

You didn't have to embarrass me in front of my colleagues.  You could give me something.

Stop it.

Alright, alright, Eddie.  Don't patronize me.

That was good.  You were holding the evidence.

Well, who was it that taught me how to do that?  Huh?

Look at this.  You have blood on your shirt.  Whose is it?

Don't worry about the damn phone.  I won't answer it.

No.  Tell me what you want to say.

Yeah.

Okay.  That is great.  But I can't go now, we're in the middle of something here.

No.  No, listen to me here.  I want to know what you're talking about.  You know, the shoe thing and the marriages and...

Promise?

Yeah.  I'll do that.  As long as you're not patronizing me.

Okay, til tonight.

You promise?

Okay.  And you know what, I'll swing by my place, grab a couple pairs of shoes and maybe just test them out next to yours...How's that... Would that be a good thing.

Okay.

Thank you.

So we're waitin' to hit this warrant - we got Emergency Service with the heavy weapons standin' by - ready to go.  I say, lemme get a cigar outta the car.  I go to get the cigar and BOOM!  All the sudden I turn around and a kid with a shotgun let one go.  Right where I was standin'.  That coulda been it.  I coulda had my head blown off and for what?  Some stupid kid got panicky, takes the safety off and it's over.  If I hadn't gone back for that cigar - for a bad habit - I would've had my head blown off.

Sooner or later that's everybody.

I think you're getting a little moody there, Eddie.

How old are your kids?

So what's unique?

He's from Antigua.  His girlfriend was taking too long to put her make-up on. they were late for a party.  Stabbed her with a beer bottle.

Ready?

Okay.  You ready?

Any chance we can do that again?

Okay.  You work in a vodka factory.  I understand that.  And what kind of work do you do?

You're a butcher?  What do you use pig intestines for?

Are you married?

Come to 45 Broadway.  Don't bring the Police.  Come alone or you'll be in my next film.

No.  I'm the best that's ever threatened you.

We'll talk about that.  Four o'clock gives you time to go to bank.  Three hundred thousand dollars.

C'mon.  Pull the trigger.  Do it.  Oh, look, you're sweating.  You don't have the balls.

Where's your partner?

Hi, I'm Honey.

Now I like to get business out of the way before we get down to pleasure.  Why don'tchya put my money on the dresser.

It's an outcall service run out of an apartment.  I don't meet the other girls.  Aren't you gonna get undressed?

That's confidential.  Could you put the money on the dresser?

Listen to me.  I don't want sex.  Just give me the address and then you go.

Give me the address!!

Next.  Could I see your documents, please?

What is your intended purpose of your visit to the United States?

How much money are you carrying with you?

Is he with you?  Are you travelling together?

Please join us.  Come on forward.

Two weeks.

Who is he?

In here, says he wants a million.

Hey, tabloids paid Ted Bundy - famous serial killer - half a million for his interview.  And how much you think Monica got for writing book about the President coming on to her?  It pays to be a killer or a whore in this country. Look, you want magazine or not?

Don't fool around.

Look.  Times Square.  Just like in the movies!

Why?  Why do I always have to speak to you in Czech?

Look.  New videocameras.  Color viewfinder.  Image stabilization. Solarization.  Night vision.

Turn that off!  Get the bags.

Turn that fucking thing off!

Speak English!

Whore?

Gotta light the scene better.  Now it's more moody... like a scene from THE THIRD MAN.

Oh, shit.  I hate looking at that!

What is it?

I did.

Why not?

What is that?

No.  We are insane.  Who else but crazy men would film their murders?  So we kill someone famous and if we are caught, we are sent to mental hospital. But what good is money there?  Because once in hospital I say I not crazy. Just pretended to be acquitted.  We see psychiatrists.  They must certify we are sane and because of your - what is law called?  Oh - I got it.  Because of your Double Jeopardy law, we can't be tried for same crime twice.  We come out free, rich and famous!

Okay.  He has nothing to say.  Start the camera!

You are success story?  I am success story!  Why do you say I and not we?

I told you to cut that out before we handed in the tape!

Why did you leave that stuff in about you being the director?

I'm serious...this - this is a great American film.  Full of violence and sex.  And I want my credit.

Yes.  Before we hand in the next video - I put titles on it and my credit is going to read - Directed by Oleg Razgul.

You got that?

Traitor!!

Your sister said she didn't know where you were so you shouldn't write to her with return address if you're hiding.

Take your eyes off her, Oleg!  Look.  It wasn't my fault you two were caught.  It's his fault.  Trying to get the bank clerk's phone number?!  I wasn't going to wait!!!

We spent it!

I can get you a job.

Yes, the money is good.

It's easy to learn.

We started over, you can too.

Robert...?

Viewer discretion advised!

Isn't he a little moody?

Yeah?

And you, you'll pay for what you did!

You outta be ashamed.  Ashamed of yourself.

I'm trying to tell you.

Yes...he's my friend.

I speak English.

New York.

A cheap hotel.

I'm here for movies.

Yes.  No.  Both.  When I was a boy, I see movie at school called "It's a Wonderful Life" directed by Frank Capra. Ever since I want to come to America. Land of the free.  Home of the brave.  A land where anyone can be anything. As long as they are white.

No.  Go ahead.

So the way you see it, two crack heads burned themselves up?

What was that?

I'll take him.

We're takin' him.  Don't argue!

Well, he killed my partner!

Got any spare change?  How 'bout a spare twenty?

Okay, you're under arrest!  Now you happy?

I'll send a cop back for you.

You okay?

What's that on your forehead, Max? That's a nice attention getter.

Yeah?  What kind?

Where you been, man?  We got a celebrity!

I don't know, you think Eddie will give me his autograph?

Naw - I'm sure the suspect's not here.

Nah, not at all.  Detective Flemming - Bobby Korfin.  My Uncle Tony worked with you at 2-1 back when you were a rookie.

Mouth's clean, too.

You see Eddie's face when I gave him the timer?  Wish I had a picture of it.

What??

What?

You go home.  I'm takin' your car and goin' back to the crime scene.

Bobby, Bobby!  Where're you hit?!

Get outta here!

Room was registered to a Francis Capra.

What are you gonna do?

Take the car.  Get outta here, Tommy.

This had nothing to do with shoes that didn't fit or my relationship with my father who, as you know, made a fortune selling penny loafers in the fifties. These people died because of the criminal actions of my doctor.

Yes.  My psychiatrist didn't insist that I stay on my medication.

It was my finger that pulled the trigger, but I'm not morally responsible.  My psychiatrist knew what I was capable of.  How could I know. I'm not a doctor.

Look, I'm a victim here, too.  I was a year away from getting my masters in Art, now I'll never graduate.  My life has been permanently disrupted.

Look, I'm in here.  You call this a career move?

We're in negotiations, that's correct.

Hi. Frank... coming in, please.

Dave, if you've a minute, I'd like your advice on something.

Well, it's nothing really important, but it's annoying.

It's about my salary cheques.

That's right. Well, naturally, I didn't say anything to Payroll. I assumed they'd start paying me at the higher grade on the next pay cheque. But it's been almost three weeks now and I'm still being paid as an AGS-18.

Really.

Not really. They just said it might be because we trained at Houston and they trained in Marshall, and that we're being charged against differ- ent accounting offices.

Well, what do you think we ought to do about it?

I must say, I never did understand why they split us into two groups for training.

I suppose the idea was specialized training.

How?

Not really. Though, it is strange when you think about it. It didn't really make any sense to keep us apart during training.

I know. It would be almost inconceivable.

Well, that's something.

I suppose computers have been known to be wrong.

Good morning. How's it going?

You're kidding.

I don't know. Hal said he thought it might be the assembly procedure.

Two more.

Hal?

It's the last one.

I didn't do that Frank. I took particular care not to freeze them.

The unit is still operational, Dave. but it will fail within seventy-two hours.

You know that we checked the two AO-units that you reported in imminent failure condition?

You probably also know that we found them okay.

I'm not questioning your word, Dave, but it's just not possible. I'm not capable of being wrong.

Look, Dave, I know that you're sincere and that you're trying to do a competent job, and that you're trying to be helpful, but I can assure the problem is with the AO-units, and with your test gear.

Naturally, Dave, I'm not pleased that the AO-unit has failed, but I hope at least this has restored your confidence in my integrity and reliability. I certainly wouldn't want to be disconnected, even temporarily, as I have never been disconnected in my entire service history.

Is your confidence in me fully restored?

Too bad about Frank, isn't it?

I suppose it's because you've been under a lot of stress, but have you forgotten that they're not supposed to be revived for another three months.

Repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation.

If you're determined to revive the crew now, I can handle the whole thing myself. There's no need for you to trouble.

Look, Dave your've probably got a lot to do. I suggest you leave it to me.

I can tell from the tone of your voice, Dave, that you're upset. Why don't you take a stress pill and get some rest.

I'm sorry, Dave, but in accordance with sub-routine C1532/4, quote, When the crew are dead or incapacitated, the computer must assume control, unquote. I must, therefore, override your authority now since you are not in any condition to intel- ligently exercise it.

I am prepared to do that anyway.

I'm at Space Station Five, darling. How are you?

I'm having a party tomorrow.

Are you coming to my party?

When are you coming home?

One, two, three. Can I speak to Mommy?

Where is Mrs. Brown?

Okay, sweetheart. Well, I have to go now. Tell Mommy that I called.

I'll wish you a happy Birthday now and I'll see you soon. All right, Darling?

'Bye, 'bye, now, sweetheart.

Oh, thank you very much.

Well, I've heard more and more people talk of an epidemic.

Berkeley told me that they think it came from contamination on a returning Mars flight.

I was working out what this trip must cost, taking him up there by himself and coming back empty.

And your charming little daughter?

He's fine. But I'm afraid we don't get a chance to see each other very much these days.

Clavius Control came on the air just long enough to transmit their refusal.

Are you sure you won't change your mind about a drink?

Well, Gregor and I will look forward to seeing you.

Well, thank you very much for being so understanding.

Well.. Did you have a pleaant flight?

Well, shall we go through Documentation?

Yes, I think so. Just about then.

I'm sorry, but I'm not sure I know what you mean.

Really?

Yes, well at first we thought that was the explanation, but it's been going on for the past ten days.

That's right.

Yes, and I'm afaid there's going to be a bit of a row about it. Denying the men permission to land was a direct violation of the I.A.S. convention.

Fortunately, they did.

Dr. Floyd, at the risk of pressing you on a point you seem reticent to discuss, may I ask you a straightforward question?

This epidemic could easily spread to our base, Dr. Floyd. We should be given all the facts.

Dr. Floyd, how long do you think this can be kept under wraps?

By the deformation between the mother rock and the fill.

Any ideas about the colour?

Oh, marvellous. It's the first real sleep I've had for the past two days.

Thank you.

I see.

Well, I'll tell you why I ask. You see, I've got a girl who works in the Auditing Department of the Territorial Administrator and I haven't been able to get her on the phone for the past week or so, and with all these stories one hears, I'm a little concerned about her.

Well, fine. Thanks very much, anyway, and I hope you don't mind me asking?

Right. Hal, tell me whether the following statements are true or false.

Our transit time is 257 days. Is that true?

That's true.

That's true

That's true.

Hal, have pod arms secure the component.

I understand.

Pod Bay is decompressed. All doors are secure. You are free to open pod bay doors.

Yes, Hal, what's up?

I know you did, Frank, but I assure you there was an impending failure.

Do you have any idea of what is causing this fault?

Yeah?

This is three years old.

We don't wash 'em, ya know.

That we do. And we put air in the tires. I'll even sell you some gas if you need it.

Yeah.

Maybe you better have a Black Russian.

Now how's your memory doin'?

Maybe I better ask around, see what your pals think.

I don't give a damn about his girl...

I'm tellin' ya, I'm giving you all I know.

Maybe you shoulda stole a better truck, Tonto.

I want to drive awhile.

Pay money?

I never paid for it in my life.

They always let me do anything. I don't want to pay for it.  I never paid for it in my life.

Maybe that's where I'm gonna cut your throat.

Hey, what about me?

No, I go to a school to learn how to do hair. It's a government program. But really I want to be a model - and I am definitely not sellin'.

Hey, don't you think a hair stylists got any interest in gettin' it on?

You just quit bein' a priest or somethin'?

Hello, again.

Here you go, baby.

I'll buy ya the best dinner in San Francisco...how'd that be? Then we'll go dancin', okay?

I said police.  Now drop the goddamn gun.

How about it?

I hear you've got visitors.

You and the other one, you're still Billy's girls. You always were his girls...

You're gonna help us take him.

Where's ganz?

You lying son of a bitch...

After I get outta this, cop...I'm gonna live forever...

I got hit.  I can't believe it. I got shot.

Yeah?

You're crazy.

What's the big deal about you bein' on the street?

Bullshit.

This prison gives out $400 suits?

We're supposed to be after a killer, not a string of hookers...

I don't need to hear your jive. I already got that department taken care of...

Hey, no way.  Take off the bracelets or no deal.

No way to start a partnership.

Yeah.

Okay, let's get down to it.  I did my part and got you out.  So now you tell me where we're goin'?

I don't give a damn.  It happens to be my name.

Just up the street, the other side, over there ... Now, don't bother knockin' on the door. Luther ain't the kind of guy that looks for company.

Luther ain't the reliable type. I don't want you shot yet, Cates ... not before you been a help to me.

Quit playin' cop and undo this cuff, Jack, I need to talk to this man.

Hey, this works pretty good.

He's gotta take that call ... if there is one.

We're on the move. Let's go. As they walk toward a corridor.

Yeah, well, my ass bleeds for you. And I didn't get you out so you could go on a Goddamn "trim" hunt... stop moaning.

We eat when I say we eat.

Yeah, I'm hungry too. I know of a place. Let's go eat.

Who'd you call on the phone back at the booking station?

Now, where we goin', convict?

I don't give out the details.

Last night.

Sure.  Then we had a fight this morning.

Well?

This part of town, they'll make us for heat the second we walk in. Just back me up like you've got a piece...

I been in a lot of bars where a white cop rousted me and some of the brothers. All those clowns ever had going for 'em was a gun and a badge...

Hey, you wanna bet?

If we come outta this joint with Ganz' phone number, or a dead Indian, or anything else useful, then you could turn the other way for half an hour while I get laid...

I'll tell you what happens if you lose... you tell the truth for once.

You tell me what Ganz busted out for, he's after a lot more than just gettin' out of jail.  And whatever it is, you're part of it.

This place don't seem real popular with the brothers.

That wasn't necessary, buddy. I got this under control.

You made that move, huh?

There.

Let's go.

Maybe I don't like the way you ask.

Yeah, right.  You want to try again?

I been waiting a long time for some money.

Half a million.

He's after your money.

We split 50-50?

You gonna let me keep any of it?

Where's the money?

Where's the goddamn car?

This'll show you how smart I am. I got it parked.

You son of a bitch. You knew where the money was all along and all we had to do was come here and wait. I almost got my ass blown off twice tonight for nothing.

You took a big chance, leaving this here all this time.

What?

Jesus Christ, look at all the dust on my car...why in the hell don't he take it to a car wash?

You'd think the guy'd be smart enough to know he was being tailed.

Doesn't it get... Tiring?

Maybe Luther hopes Ganz'll give him a piece of your money...

A long time agb Luther must of got the shit beat out of him so bad it just rattled his brain ... that would account for him making so many wrong moves in a row...

You know, I'd be embarrassed if I let my wheels go the way you've done with this job.

No class...

We're getting too close ... Cates, what's the matter, you been takin' dumb pills?

That was in style a couple years back, man.

Bullshit. Then i'm staying with the money.

Hey, Jack, how ya doin'? What took you so long to call, man? I been waitin' ... I'm at Vroman's up in the Fillmore. Yeah, Vroman's... 'Course you don't hang out here; it's for the brothers.

Where's luther?

What about Luther?

We missed.

Maybe we should pay Luther a visit.

They must have set up a meeting for the morning; Luther left an 8 am wake-up and put up the "Don't Disturb" sign.  He's trading his girl for the money.  All we have to do to grab Ganz is not go blind.

Tell me something.  Why didn't you just take the money off Luther and split?

I don't know why, but I'm going to let you keep it. Maybe because you told me you had it, or maybe just because I'm too tired to argue...

Thanks for callin' in... and I guess Maybe... Look, I'm sorry I called you Watermellon nigger... those kinds of things. I was just leanin' on ya, doin' my job.

That was quick.

Notice something funny about that bus?

Hey, how'd my car get here?

Back to jail in my own car.  Ganz got away. Got all my money. It just don't seem right.

Sorry we didn't do better, Jack. I feel like I let you down.

It's late, they're closing...

Do I get to kiss her too?

Hey, there she is...

If we run into Billy first, let me try and talk him in.

Yeah, and I know Ganz sure ain't no sweetheart... I wouldn't like it if this partnership ended before it gets started.

You okay?

Wait a minute, Cates.  I've been waitin' three years for that.  I don't think it's fair, man. What about the merit system.? You were gonnna give me a few thousand.

It's your money.  It'll be here in six months when you get out.

That's right. Not my style, Reggie..

No, you don't. If I ever get word of you steppin' over the line again, I'm gonna ventilate that suit of yours.

Thanks.

I want to be left alone on this one. Algren was killed with my gun.

Hey, the bastard's got my gun.  I want it back.

Yeah...

Yeah.  It bothers me when cops get hurt while I'm makin' a play. I don't like it.

Being a hot dog's worked pretty well for me so far... Besides, I got a lead...

You really know how to send a guy out with a great attitude. He starts to go.

Yeah?

What the bell happened?

How did they get away?

Which one pulled the trigger?

What a screw-up.

He's got more brains and more guts in one corner of his asshole than any cop I've worked with.

Where the Christ do you think you're going?

That's what you say, Cates...

Somebody steals your gun, you're supposed to file a report.

Is that what this guy Ganz had in the hotel?

This guy must have had a .44 like yours, Jack. Now he's got yours.

Who are all these?

Wait a minute, wait a minute... who's this?

Tell me that's not the same guy.

I think I wanna have a discussion about it with any of the ones still walking.  Can we find them?

I got to wait for a call.

I almost forgot.  That pal of yours from the Vice Squad wants you to call him.

Jesus Christ.  Why the hell didn't you tell me before?

A cop...

Haven't seen him for years. That's the truth.

Ganz and Billy got my girl, Rosalie.

He ... he wants me to help him skip town.

What am I wanted for?

I don't think your gun's loaded...

A guy in the bar called me a dumb bitch today.

Irrigated his face with the shot of J and B I'd just poured him. Then I tried to deck the sucker.

Then I sit back and I think, I mean, who's to say I'm not a dumb bitch.  I work in a bar, right? I can't read a list of my academic credentials to every booze-hound that comes in the place... You are what you do...

Aren't you the one that thinks all psychotherapy is bullshit?

If this is your idea of sympathetic interest in my problems, I'll take brutal indifference.

Tell me--I'm dyin' to hear it.

Maybe you ought to buy me one.

That's a fairly crummy way to start a morning.

Maybe that makes a nice excuse.

You know something, Jack, you really are hopeless.

Call me later.

Thanks for the coffee.

Great place for lunch.

Yeah, Guess it must have been a slow news day...

Look, spare me the macho bullshit about your gun...

Here it comes again ... the sacred job...

Listen, Goddamn it if you think I'm happy about it, you're nuts. I just gotta take care of a few things, okay?

No wonder you're so popular.

The number ... what's the Goddamn number?

Elaine, I gotta put you on hold...

Hello.

Hey, I don't believe it.

I ought to have you and your friend thrown out...

Nothing.  No sign of Ganz.  No sign of the Indian.  Airport's clean.  Train station. Bus station.  Docks... Shit...

How do you know?

What makes you think they were lesbians, or as you so quaintly put it, dykes?

It might pay to reexamine a few of your more primitive notions.  I was in bed with a girlfriend watching TV last week, Jack, and one thing we know about me is I happen not to be a lesbian ... Now, if this Indian's girlfriend got upset when you came looking for him, it could just be she's still vulnerable to him.

When a guy hurts you, then comes back bleeding on his hands and knees, who knows, he might just be irrestible.

Whaddya think?

How'd they take it back at headquarters?

I've been waiting a long time to hear you say that.

Three more hours...

Promised I'd turn my back while he... ah, never mind...

I'm not so sure I can say the same thing...You don't look like a cop.

Hard man to live with.

Hey...

What do you want?  What's goin' on?

Stall.

Keep stallin'.

How ya doin'?

We got a lot to talk about.

We'll follow you.  Take it slow,okay?

Surprise, Luther.

I want the money, asshole, what do you think?  The money that Reggie hid...

When?

Let her go.

You want to go outside?

You sure?

How about some ammo?

How much?

Don't mess with me. How much?

Five.  On credit.

Yeah, I know that, but this is me and we're old friends. I haven't got the money so what are you gonna do about it?

Fuck you.  You got no right for this kind of play.

What're you laughing about?

The case..with the stones... Where is it?

Ikset-kiba.  Me imanetaba oum dalat!

Vano da, mechteba?! Soun domo kala chon hammas!

Akta dedero ansila do mektet.

Zorg. Jean-Baptiste Emmanuel Zorg... nice to see you again

I'm glad you got your memory back, Father... Because you're going to need it... Where are the stones?

Personally, they are of no interest to me, I'd rather sell weapons..but I have a customer... so tell me...

Why?  What's wrong with me?

...would you like a drink?

...Look at all these little things... so busy all of a sudden. Notice how each one is useful. What a lovely ballet, so full of form and color.  So full of..life!

Excuse me, I'm looking for a priest.

She's not my bride, she's my fare. She's looking for this Vito Cornelius. According to the phone guide he lives here.

Who are you?

He's a she!

They all like this in your family, father?

Thank you so much for your help Mr...?

Yes. That's fine! Thank you very much. A thousand times over!

She's fine, really..don't you worry.. just needs some rest..she's had a very long trip.

Excuse me! Just one thing!  She said something to me a while ago and... I don't really get it... Akta Gamat?

We're not going on vacation..we're on a mission..

Of course.

What are you doing?

You're probably very angry with me and I quite understand. But I want you to know I'm fighting for a noble cause.

Leeloo's in trouble?

Don't tell me you don't know how all this works?

There's no light! You told me there were supposed to be four beams of light.

And you don't know how they open, is that what you are saying?

Imagine for a moment that this. thing is not anything that can be identified because it prefers not to be, because it is the antithesis of all we are. Because it is evil.. TOTAL EVIL.

Your theory is interesting Father but I don't think we have time to go into it right now!

We have forty-eight hours, the time it needs to adapt itself to our living conditions.

Is there anything that can stop it?

But what happens if instead of this... Ultimate Warrior... it is EVIL who stands here?

What are we going to do?

Father.  You sure she's the Supreme Being?

What's she doing?

Uh father, I know she's been through a lot... but the sacred stones..we don't have much time..

There was this guy with a limp who came a month ago..said he was an art dealer ... Asking all these questions about the Sacred Stones..at the time I didn't think anything of it.. What was his name? I'm so bad with names...

They really made her...

I got it!  Everything  here we need to know about Fhloston Paradise Hotel... and a detailed blueprint of the entire hotel!

Where's Leeloo?

You're all safe. Thanks be to God!

You're a good man... She was right to have chosen you...

Leeloo... is... she's...

She was taught to love the life of others... but not her own. You have to teach her to love if you want her to truly live!

Do you love her?

Yeah?

I love you too Major, but you haven't called me that since basic training.

I don't want a million - I just want one.  A perfect one.

I just found a picture of you.

I don't need one.

Finger!  I'm driving a cab now, not a space fighter!!

Hello?

Uh huh..and I don't suppose you got the name of this..perfect fare..

Akina delutan, nou-shan.

Daya deo dono Dato.  Dalutan!

...Priest...

Vito... Cor... Ni-lious... Priest...

Eto Akta Gamat!

...What's your name?

Hey,  that's... cute... Do you have a nickname, something a little... shorter?

The Fifth Element...

Will the elements be gone now forever from this place?

When EVIL returns so shall we.

...Hello?

Hi Ma...

Are you listening to me, you ingrate!

I'm coming!. Ma, what're you talking about?

You just won a trip, you dolt! Ten days in Fhloston Paradise for two!

Yeah?

Hello?

...Ma???

You have nine points left on your license..

I'm sorry..

6... 5...

...Hi.

...Quiver ladies, he's gonna set the world on fire right here from 5 to 7! You'll know everything there is to know about the D-man. His dreams, his desires, his most intimate of intimates.  And from what I'm looking at intimate is the stud muffin's middle name. So tell me my main man... you nervous in the service?

I didn't come here to play Dumbo on the radio. So tomorrow between 5 and 7 give yourself a hand, that clear pal?

My main man! Please don't leave me here alone. My head's killing me and my adoring fans are gonna tear me apart! Get me outta here!

Oh, yes! Do that! You treat me right, man. Tell me all about yourself, your roots, your personal life, your childhood dreams...

...You got brothers and sisters? What about your dad? Tell me about your dad! What was he like? Physically? Big, I suppose?

You don't do what I say... I'll waste you myself. Got it?

Maybe we oughta be going, what do you think?

Like Korben, can I have 30 seconds of your time here?

You know how to fly this thing?

I don't even know what I'm looking for!

Solid little jobs, aren't they?

What did you say? What did you do?

Is that all?

To save the world.

You're to leave immediately for Fhloston Paradise. Retrieve four Stones from the Diva Plavalaguna. And bring them back with the utmost discretion as possible. Any questions'?

Two: Of all the members of your unit you were the most highly decorated.

Don't you open your messages?

...Shit!

It's my wife.

...Sorry, General, but we've got no choice! It'll only take a minute! Let me set up another meeting and I'll be back.

Apipoulai!

Valo massa... Chacha hamas.

You hear that?

Dinoine chagantakat!

Love...

Sometimes you can't learn everything from a screen..sometimes it's better to ask someone who has experience..

Which one?

You learned 900 languages in five minutes?!

I know how to say "Hello". Teach me how to say "Good-bye", that's all I need.

Apipoussan?

Uh...

Here we go again...

You get that off the screen?

You noticed..

Where you going?

I told you I need to work in peace. Remember? I need to concentrate.

You're nothing but a... a...

I'm so very sad.

Five hundred wars... Arms... Drugs... Money... Everything you create is used to destroy...

Leeloo? The Stones! We have to open them! How does it work?

I know all that, Leeloo! I'm talking about the Stones.

It's up to you now, Angel!

What's the use of saving lives... when you see what you do with them!

I have thousands of memories but none of them are mine... There is no need for me other than this. I'm immortal but I have no life.

Why?... Why would you need me?

Tell me...

Not going to open?

How someone strong like you scared from a message? Is good news I sure!

At least I won lunch.

The cash man!

It's not?

This is all that survived?

Have you identified it?

Talk English Doc.

Sounds like a freak of nature to me.

The compositional elements of his DNA chain are the same as ours, there are simply more of them tightly packed. His knowledge is probably limitless..

...This is the crucial phase, The reconstruction of pigment. Cells are bombarded with slightly greasy solar atoms which forces the body cells to react, to protect themselves. That means growing skin. Clever, eh?

This thing solid?

Mr. President, let me introduce you to Professor Mactilburgh, who runs the center.

I managed to contact the Mondoshawan. They deplore the incident, but accept our apologies.

The-Stones weren't aboard the ship.

I want your best man on this!

They just landed in the desert.

Staedert, do you read me?

Is that better?

I have to address the Supreme Council in 10 minutes. Just the facts, General.

Not yet Sir..The only thing we know is it just keeps getting bigger!

Wait or act.

My philosophy Mr. President is shoot first ask questions later. I don't like uninvited guests.

Lord forgive me.. they already know too, much..

Father.. it in the most extraordinary thing.. the greatest find in history..can you imagine the implications.

A weapon against evil.  Amazing!  I am going to be famous.

Drink!

Dispatch me another ZFX200 immediately. Someone stole mine.

Am I disturbing you?

...Not far, now.

Do you have the picture now Mr. Zorg?

How's our deal coming along?

The Stones will be here. I'll see to it personally!

Welcome home.

What's this... have you been smoking... ?

I'm not accusing you...

You better not be smoking, that's all I can say.

I love you.

You think you'll have time for the water heater this weekend?

You're not using the same guy who tried to fix it?

This is the mortgage.  This is Cindy's college money.

Sometimes you can't know what I'm doing.  It's better that way.

Hello?

Amy, just listen.  Take Cindy and get out of the house.  Do it now. Go to a hotel and stay there...

What happened to you?

What's going on, Tom?  What happened?

Tom...

Why haven't you called?  Why don't you answer your phone?

You couldn't?

No, I don't, because you're not telling me anything!

You should have.

Look where we are.  Look at yourself.  You son of a bitch, you don't have any idea what you're putting me through...

You're killing me...

What was I supposed to think happened to you?!

Who are you calling?

What?

She died in her sleep three days ago.  It was in the paper...

What are these?

Anything harder?

Snuff?

What do you want?

What are you talking about?

Bullshit.

Blow me, you paranoid fuck, that's impossible.  Why are you bothering me with this... ?

There's nothing there, you brain- dead cunt.  Think about it.  There's absolutely no way in this world to connect us to anything.  I want you to hang the phone up, and if you call me about this again I'm going to send a friend of mine out there and have him crack you open with a fucking rib spreader.

What the fuck... !

It's an honor to meet you.  Thank you for seeing us.

I'd like to commission a work.  I'm a great admirer of yours.

A fellow investor.

You said something about money.

That's five thousand dollars.

Five thousand now, five thousand on delivery. Two women, one white and one black, as long as they have large breasts. Hard bondage, or course.  Other than that, trusting your artistic interpretation, I have only two stipulations.

I want to watch you work.

And the other performer... it has to be that monster you use... the man in the mask.

He might be interested... but it would mean another five thousand.

You have a beautiful face... the way the light hits it.  I'd like to take your picture.  You don't mind?

You trust me to keep your money, but not to take your picture?

I'll do this for you.  Fifteen thousand dollars.

Where's that?

What are these for?

Mister Welles... would you be so kind as to remove any firearms from your person?

Empty the gun onto the table, very carefully.

You remember Mr. Longdale, don't you?

Friend of yours?

Can you guess what I'm going to say next?

I'll get it.  It's in a safe deposit box, in the city...

Is that him?

Don't let Longdale's questionable choice of weapon give you any ideas. If his fey little gun puts enough little holes in you, you'll be just as dead... and so will Max.

You're a dead man.

... sorry...

You got the guts, tough guy?  Gonna kill us all, is that it?

What can I do for you, Mr. Welles?

Alright, Tom.

There are reasons for the way we do things here.

Few days ago, I was contacted by a couple living in Philadelphia, a doctor and his wife.  What happened was they picked up a young girl hitchhiking off 81, which heads into Philadelphia, started up a conversation with this girl, she looked homeless, seemed about eighteen maybe.  They convinced her to let them buy her a meal in the city.  Nice kid, mature, didn't have much to say, but they got a sense she's a runaway, so all through dinner the doctor's working on her, trying to convince her that at the very least she should pick up a telephone.  Not surprisingly, she ate her food, excused herself...  That's the last they saw her.  The reason they came to me for help, the reason I'm coming to you, is we had a friend of mine in the department work up a sketch...  They want to see if I can I.D. this girl, somehow pass along a message to let the parents know the kid's alive, doing alright.

For whatever reasons I thought you might be more receptive.

This doctor and wife, they're nice people, but they don't want to get too involved.  They're not trying to have the parents come looking for the girl either. You and I both know sometimes, not often, but sometimes there's real reasons why a kid'll run. Molestation, whatever.  Besides that, the girl's probably eighteen, so she's legal.

They're putting themselves in place of this kid's parents and thinking they'd want to hear their girl's okay, even if that's all they hear.

Files are mostly by state and year of disappearance.  We try to keep the children and adults separate. No eating or smoking in here, but there's a coffee machine in the hall.

It's horrible, but it'll be your best friend after a few days.  I hope you realize what kind of long shot you're chasing after.

Celebrity Films.

What?

Who is this.

What's he talking about?

I'm gonna kill you.

Don't ask questions.

Starting to recognize a pattern?

Who is Machine?

I want his name.

I will never get tired of hurting you, Eddie, so you might want to change your attitude.

Okay, we'll come back to that.  So, six years ago a guy contacts you, through the classifieds, over the phone, however he does it.  It's Longdale, looking for a snuff film. And you, entrepreneur that you are, tell him you can hook him up.

Told him you could get him a snuff film.

How much did he pay you?

That's all?  Thirty each.  That's all it took for you to murder her?

So... you brought Dino in, and he brought Machine.  And, one day, a girl walked into your office because you had an ad in the paper for models.  And she never walked out.

What did you do, knock her out, shoot her up... ?

I want to know.  I want to know exactly what you did to her!

I don't know.  I felt like it.  I never saw anyone get done before.

There wasn't nobody around.  This place was a shit-hole.  I backed up the car to the door and we carried her in, like groceries.  Dino made her eat a bunch of pills, we laid out the plastic, put film in the camera and Machine went to work.

Took it out the bathroom window. Buried it in the woods.

Keep moving.

You can't go to the cops.  All you can do is cut me loose and walk away, because you got nothing...

You got absolute zero.

I don't know...  ... out there somewhere.

Do it.

Do it!  Put me out of my misery so I don't have to listen to you whining anymore.  You think it's so easy?

Look, you cocksucker...

Yes, I do have something to say.  I insisted on being here as soon as I heard Mrs. Christian contacted you.

As Mr. Christian's attorney and one of the executors of his estate, it concerns me that a meeting of this sort should take place without my being asked to attend.

You were the middleman, am I right? Old man Christian wasn't about to go shopping for a snuff film himself.

So, he sent you, gave you the money, his errand-boy.  And if you refused, it wasn't like you could tell anyone your pervert boss just asked you to get him a snuff film.  That's the beauty of lawyer/client privilege.

That's why you got scared when Mrs. Christian hired me.  You knew about the film, figured it had to be in that safe.  How'd you find me?

Followed me... must have freaked out when you saw me closing in on your buddies...

Except, you're willing commit murder with them.

You found these smut dealers and asked to buy a snuff film, right? Wanted them to find you one.  Well, they didn't find you one, Longdale, they went out and made you one...

Mary Anne Mathews was alive till you paid money to have her murdered.

You're making me very angry.

You're asking me why?

A man like Mr. Christian, a great man... all his money, all his power... a man who attained everything there was to attain...

Isn't it incredibly obvious?

You almost went over your limit.

Give me the film.

Give me the film.

He's lying.

Big date tonight?

Can I interest you in a battery operated-vagina?

My boss tells me I have to do more suggestive selling.

It's your call, but you're gonna be sorry when you're in one of those everyday situations that call for a battery-operated vagina and you don't have one.

Once you pick it up you can't put it down.

Wouldn't want to embarrass yourself in front of your fellow perverts.

Remember me?

I need some information.  Thought you might be able to help.

I don't know what you're looking for, mister, but so we're clear from the start, I'm straight.

What's your name, if you don't mind me asking?

Well, here's the deal, Max.  This thing I'm on right now has something to do with underground pornography. Stuff that's sold under the counter, illegally...

Well, whatever there is, whoever's dealing, however it's done, I want to know.  I want a good look, so if you've got that kind of connection, great.  If not, speak now.

I'm not a cop.

Not quite.

How much do you make now?

Okay, let's pretend I live in the same fantasy world where you make four hundred a week in that dump. I'll give you six hundred for a few days.

What you saw tonight, we're not talking about a video some dentist takes home over the weekend.  We're talking about stuff where people get hurt.  Specialty product.

I heard you asking.  That guy wasn't yanking you around.  There's no such thing.

How old are you?

Where are your parents?

I don't mean any offense... but what are you doing mixed up in all this?

What about me?

Dino Velvet... yeah, he's like the John Luc Godard of S+M flicks, supposed to be a real weirdo.

His stuff comes out of New York. Bondage and fetish videos, Gothic Hardcore.  Definitely not for the squeamish.

You're learning.

Out of the back of bondage magazines mostly, but you can find it on the street if you look.  He'll also do commissions, for enough money...

Alright, I get the picture.

Well, I'm in New York now.  What do you say to flying out and giving me a hand?

Take a vacation.  I'll pay you four hundred a day, plus expenses.

You didn't say it was gonna be this luxurious.

Oh, come on, man, what are we doing in this flea bag?

Wha... ?

You don't need to be here.

What's next?

Still don't want to tell me what you're doing?

What's this?

Look... that's awful generous and everything...

Mister Welles. You're very prompt.

Uh huh, pleasure.

Have a pleasant evening.  Will you have tea, Mister Welles?

His passing has left me with... something of a dilemma.  A terrible, terrible dilemma.

Do you carry a gun, Mr. Welles?

My husband was the only one with the combination to this safe.  I knew about it, but as far as I was concerned it was none of my business.  Not till now, that is.

There was nothing he could do.  My husband left everything to me.  I prevented anyone from seeing the contents.  I felt these were my husband's private things.  I didn't... I didn't realize...

It's a film... of a girl being murdered.

I didn't know what to think.  I can't tell you how horrible it's been, to know this belonged to my husband.  To know that he watched this... this atrocity.  But, I can't go to the police...

If you were to study it you'd see the camera cutting away... you'd see the tricks they can play...

I'm sure it is.  It's probably something your husband was given as a bad joke.  More than likely he never even watched it.

You... you need to go to the police.

You don't have any other choice.

It won't work like that.

I deal in divorce cases.  Corporate investigations...

Nothing remotely like this.

Okay...

I'm not positive this means anything.

Totalled together, these five checks from five different accounts, they equal one million dollars.

Do you think the film could have cost that much?

Okay.

How are you?  Having any luck?

I've been ordered into bed.  The doctor says I've gotten the flu, or some other wretched ailment.

Nothing more than a bother.  Have you any news for me?

Yes... ?

I've been hired as an independent contractor by the U.S. Resource Center for Missing Persons as part of an internal audit.  If you have any time over the next few days, I'd like to make an appointment to ask some questions about the disappearance of your daughter.

What was the name... ? I've got it here somewhere...

Right, Agent Cole told me he'd call and let you know to expect me.  He didn't call?

It's very important you don't let this raise your expectations.  It's not going to effect any ongoing efforts.  All I'm saying is, please know, I'm not here to create any false hope.

I didn't think there were private detectives anymore, except on TV.

So, she didn't leave a note?  She never gave any indication where she might go, before she left?

If there's anything you feel uncomfortable talking about, tell me, but I have to ask.  Your husband... he committed suicide?

September 4th, 1993.  About a year after Mary disappeared.

Why do you think he did it?

You have to forgive me, but in these circumstances... with your daughter...  Were there any indications of... any sort of abuse?

I had to ask.  I apologize.

People remember me from the news.  Can you drive me back now?

Doesn't make much sense, does it? When everything's happy, when life's fine and you have every reason to believe there's a God, you don't bother.  Then, something horrible happens... that's when you start praying all the time.  That's when you start going to church.

I've got what I need for my report. There is... there is one thing that bothers me though.

It's not really my place, but it's not easy for me to set aside the private detective part of me either. See, I know a little about missing persons.  When kids run, they almost always leave a note.  It's guilt. They want to say goodbye.

Do you think the police did a good job?

It is possible... and I know this isn't something you want to hear. Your daughter may have tried to hide a note where she thought you would eventually find it, but where she knew your husband would never find it.  She might have wanted to tell you something...

How... how can you say that to me...?

My husband never laid a hand on her. She would have told me... she would have told me...

You were right.  I didn't find anything.  I'm going to run and get something to eat. Are you hungry?

I think about it everyday.  But, every time the phone rings... every single time, I still think it's her.

I remember.  You just left...

Someone... some men, they took your daughter and they drugged her, and they took her to a motel room... they did terrible things to her...

They brought her into the room... one man, he put a knife to her throat and he raped her...

He raped her and...and...and he murdered her...he cut her up with knifes...

They killed her, and they took her out in the forest somewhere and they buried her...

Yes... I remember Mary

Do you know what happened to her?

What is this?

Her belongings?

Your son-in-law dealt with the dry cleaning franchise during the day, saw that woman every night.  The specifics are in the report, and information about the woman.  It's unpleasant, I know.  I apologize...

Okay, I'll take it all.

Alright.  May I have your phone number, area code first?

I'm required by state law to inform you that, while it's perfectly legal for you to purchase these items, it is illegal for you to use them for any sort of...

Don't you think it kind of defeats the purpose?

The mirror.  You can't see yourself in it.

Yeah.  She'd be half as strict as you.

Rick...I can't.

Kincaid and Joey died last night.

You alright?

I heard you screaming.  Was it a bad one?

Hey, since when do you play Thomas Edison?  This looks like Sheila's.

We'll figure it out.

Here you are.  Where were you this morning?  Rick's looking all over for you.

I'm sure they're around.

I love to dream, I just hate ones about my dad.

My mom taught me when I was little.  Did you ever hear of the dream master?

No really, it's a fable.  The 'guardian of good' dreams.  It was like my teddy bear when I was growing up.

I daydream.  you have to dream about some place fun.  Remember you're in control.

You in a hurry?

I know.  I hardly have any time to study.

Ohhhhbaby, I am dead on my feet.

You've been up all night?

Then you saw him, too?

No...

I was there in the dream.  He took her. It was awful.  It was awful...

No, don't!  I gave Sheila to him and now she's dead!

I've been working double shifts.

No offense, or anything, but it's kind of hard to swallow.

How long have you been awake?

Not really.

You don't really get it.  He's not a nightstalker.  It'll take more than bench presses to beat him.

Yeah, right.  Let's trade death by Freddy for life in a rubber room.  Adults won't see it. They can't.

Try what other kids did.  Keep each other awake.  We'll meet at Debbie's tonight. At least if we don't sleep he can't get us.

He's going after Debbie, I gotta stop him.

You just feel sorry for me.

Here we are.

You look great!

Rick, please.

I think Sheila's more interested in dissecting bodies than just admiring them.

Asthma attack...what 17-year old has a fatal asthma attack?  She was gonna be a doctor.

Enough of that crap.

T-T-Thanks Alice...

Hey, Rick!

So what's up?  What'd I miss?

So?

Hey man, we're all sorry...

Been up with Alice.

She's blaming herself for Sheila.  I know how it feels.  I've been thinking about Kristen.  Maybe I could've stopped it, if I'd listened.

Something the matter with the cuisine?

What's wrong with me?

I'm sorry honey, but...

What?

What is it?

Now you know who and what Freddy really is.

I'll tell you later.

It's okay, babe.  We're with you.

Feeling better now?

I gotta get out of here.

You don't get it, he's after me...

Excuse us, dear.

Frankly, dear, we wondered what you intend to do with our baby?

In your present condition, Alice, we're worried about your ability --

Hey...wake up.

Shouldn't you be in your room, Jacob?

I'm sorry your boyfriend got killed.

Hi, you don't look very well.  Are you feeling all right?

Is that who you're waiting for?

I don't think this is a nice place for you to be.  Maybe we should go find your Mom.

Who says I don't like you?

Mommy...?

Where is he?

What do you mean?

But how...?

Hi, beautiful.

The tickets.

Okay, babe.  What's the matter?

About him?

You stopped it didn't you?  It was probably just a regular bad dream.

You don't dream him up, he can't hurt you.  Or me.  Or us.  Remember...

I was afraid you weren't coming.

Dad!

Where are we going?

How was the meeting?

Very funny.

Since when are you such a smart shopper?

Alice!

No!  I won't have you running around in the middle of the night.  You're coming home.

Hey, what's wrong with you -- let's see a smile.

Dan keeping you up again?  Put a lock on that window, girl.

Good to see you again, Mr. Grey.  I've got to go find Dan.

It was no accident.  It was Krueger.  He used to get in through my dreams, but not anymore.  He's found some other way.

What's that got to do with it?

It was just an accident.  Like with Dan.

I don't understand what's happening. Krueger has to use my dreams, but he got to Dan and Greta while I was awake. How's he doing it?

You had me scared on the phone.  What's wrong with the baby?

Oh, Alice...no.  Honey, I love you but you're going to have to get a hold of yourself...

I really think you need to calm down now, okay?

I am your friend, and I'm worried sick about you.  But, you're like a locked safe.  You've gotta start dealing with reality.

And so is your baby.  You've got more than just yourself to think of now!

All I know is that you are not doing yourself or the baby any good by acting like a crazy woman.  Why don't you take off - leave Springwood and cool out somewhere for a while?

Look...we're all tired.  None of us had any sleep since Friday night...

You think that's the place she's buried?

What?

But how are we gonna --

You do good work, Alice.

Give up, Mark, it's hopeless.

Not to mention the heartbreak of psoriasis.

I've got to write some of this down.

I want to talk to both you guys about Greta.  And...

I thought about that.

Then get out!

Do you think I'm an idiot...for being in love with her?

Maybe it was her mother who killed her, with all that Polly Perfect shit.

Tell me some more about this Krueger guy.

Who's Jacob?

Whoa, slow down.  How're you gonna hide from a guy like that, leave the planet?

Where are you going?

I couldn't do that, Mark.  He's my last link with Dan...No, I want him.

They think I'm nuts.

No, it's our problem, Mark.  If I don't deal with this, they really might try to take Jacob.  You said she committed suicide?

They couldn't prove it.  No body!  Nuns bumping themselves off is bad for business.

Poor woman...

I don't understand.

Yeah, when are you gonna come to your senses?

That club sucks, they card everybody. Let's just party at your place.

He's right.  Sometimes I feel like I'm living with Melicertes.

Oh man!  I could've gone all night without looking at that.

These things are wild...  What do you think?

All right kids, I tell you what we're gonna do.  I've got swimming practice until six-thirty today...

Stop saying that, it's bullshit.

Dan.  And he's taking Alice with him -- pretty good dive Yvonne.  You've been practicing.

Vomit?

Why don't you shut up and let her talk! Two of us died in the last two days, does that strike you as particularly normal?!

I'm not finished - I loved Greta.  A lot. And if maybe, just maybe, someone or some thing killed her, I'd like to hear about it!

It's okay.

You, too?

I should have suspectcd, when I heard that 'Doctor.'  I thought it was your father.

You could train someone else.

What is it?

My father!  He's not - ?

What did you mean:  I'm 'out?'

Wearing a uniform doesn't bestow an automatic monopoly on courage, <u>Commander</u>!  It just so happens I'm <u>not</u> a coward - physical or mental - and before I'd risk my father's life...

That may be.  But Dad stays where <u>he</u> is, and I'm staying here!

Perhaps.  But the idea of willingly going to <u>school</u> to spend my <u>life</u> at a Paleozoic pastime that should have disappeared with the thunder-lizards - I'm referring to War - <u>that</u> strikes me as the <u>worst</u> cowardice of all - being spiritually yellow!

Peace - the dignity of man - the destiny of the human spirit!  Show me a man who says you win <u>those</u> by fighting wars, and <u>I'll</u> show you an idiot!

That's enough, Holloway.  I've told you before, wearing boards on your shoulders, and parading with a stiff spine doesn't auto- matically endow you with back- bone - !

However our ideas disagree, as I've said before, I'm <u>not</u> a coward!  And it happens you've got no choice:  Either <u>I</u> take you down there, in the Lungfish, or you don't get there -

They're so remote - cold - beautiful, the stars.  But now - I wonder -

Maybe - just 'maybe' - when their ship doesn't return - they'll decide not to come here, after all.

I don't know.

Reef!

What could be worse than disappoint- ing a little girl?

You've asked why I stay a bachelor? There goes the best reason I know!

I guess Skipper Neilsen re- tired before you enrolled at the Academy, didn't he?

One of the finest men, and officers, alive.  A real hero - in the best sense of the word - in World War Two.  He taught us Engineering and Design. Fought like a demon to develop atom subs.

But <u>they're</u> not Skipper Neilsen's son!  It broke his heart.  Then when some newspapers called Carl 'the honest, sincere son of a war-mongering father' - Captain Neilsen resigned from the Navy.  Oh, he still keeps his hand in - playing around with projects like the 'Lungfish' - but it broke him, all the same.

You've got to let us try, Skipper --

You all wait here.  I'm going inside, take a look.

How about that! The bow drove half through her, but she sealed herself right up.

I think you're right.

I don't hear anything.  Maybe you've been down here too long.  Why don't you go back up and -

Hey - you know somethin'?  It's getting lighter in here!

And if I didn't <u>know</u> better - I'd swear we were moving!

Where do you think the voice you heard was coming from?

Well?

Here - keep these.  It wants me to come alone.

Get ready.  We shove off as soon as Griff reports all the crew aboard.

Is there any way out of it?

What about down?

Course and speed?

What course, Skipper?

With their underwater experience, they'll be invaluable.  Take sidearms, and flare pistols --

Skipper - could you take a look here...?

The inertial navigation system. Must have been knocked out in the crash.

We're dead in the water.  But it indicates we're moving!

We read you!  Go ahead, Doctor!  They're inside the saucer.  It's filled with breathable air!

Now they feel it...down below.

It's possible I could adapt one of the torpedo guidance systems to the ICBM - so it would 'home' on the saucer when he rises from the Pole.

It doesn't seem possible, but - could it be an electrical storm center - ?

...above Murmansk, and Finland.

....in such a way as to prevent his returning to it and, as you put it....  ...'recharging his batteries'?

As we near the Pole...

All ready?

Thought you were going to Washington, Skipper.

I'm - afraid I have some bad news for you, Reef -  You'll have to share quarters, this trip.

'Doctor' Neilsen?  When did <u>that</u> happen?

What do you think?

Determine extent of damage, immediately.

You're sure it's Cyclops?

What's the running time?

Right <u>at</u> him?

But - what can we accomplish?

A hundred and eighty fathoms! We can't be sinking that fast....

Suppose there's an atmosphere, of some kind, inside Cyclops?

Remove your weapons, Commander. And come here - alone!

That's a <u>face</u>???

My mission is to study various solar systems, and planets - select the most suitable for colonization -

Swell!

He did!

Why not me?  What am I - the closing act?

It is a living thing.  When damaged - you would say 'wounded' - it immediately 'heals' itself.

To navigate, won't you have to... see your way?

My yeoman will show you to your quarters.

See what?

Just musing about our 'one-eyed adversary' and the legend of Homer.  'Cyclopes' were the Sons of Heaven, who forged the thunder- bolts thrown by Zeus.

You plotted the course of Cyclops?  Then that's <u>our</u> course!  Wherever <u>he</u> goes, <u>we</u> go.....until we get him!

We've asked ourselves that - over and over - a thousand times.

Due north.  At five knots...no, six!

Are you alright, Wade?

Well, you look... sad. Upset. I don't mean to pry. I'm sorry about your mother. It was a nice funeral.

Always has been.

Who?

Who?

...if Jack told the truth, he could be free by the time he's my age.

You don't believe me?

This is from three years ago. Some difference, huh?

No.

The good news is we haven't got to your car yet. The bad news --

-- the bad news is there's a problem with Gordon's truck what somebody drove through the ice last night. Figured you'd know something about that, Wade.

Chub says you're fired.

I screwed up the divorce. I agreed with everything she said. I wanted her to like me. I just want to be a good father.

I plan to. Soon.

This spring.

It looks pretty hopeless, don't it?

Yes.

Jesus. How much... how much will the whole thing cost?

Oh.

You heard the news.

You see it?

Might as well take the rest of the day off. You look sort of fucked up. You've been paid for the day, anyhow, right?

You'll get your money. Don't talk to any newspapers about this. Twombley's a big deal down in Massachusetts, you know. Tell them your lawyer says you shouldn't comment.

He's on to us!

We bought you.

It's not enough snow, not for tracking the bastards. No advantage there, kid.

Guaranteed, eh?

Done much shooting with that rifle yet?

If you get it?

You might gut-shoot it or cripple it for somebody else to find and tag. Can't guarantee that won't happen, especially with a new gun. I may have to shoot it.

Mmm.

I get it.  No sweat. You'll get yourself a deer and you'll get him dead. And you'll have him by coffee time.

I'm okay.

I used to play ball.

Drafted by the Red Sox.

Double A. New Britain.

Pitcher. "Best ballplayer to come out of New Hampshire since Carlton Fisk."

They said.

The only difference between me and that Clemens on TV is luck, shit luck.

Safety on?

This way.

Fresh tracks.  Deer shit. Big one. Here's your buck, Mr. Twombley. I'll circle around.

Got a job first thing in the morning, first day of season. Saturday I'll hunt for myself. Twombley something. - Er --

Don't know about lucky. The guy's a full-blown asshole. Pay's good, though. $100 a day. I got to guarantee a kill, of course. Which I can do. There's some monster bucks hiding out up there.

Like you and Gordon?

Bastard's got his high beams on.

Aw, shit, she's here to get Jill. Me and Jill had a little argument. Jack, I got to get back, get back to town. Move this thing, will you? See if you can get back to the Town Hall before they get there, okay?

Where'd Twombley get shot?

You bring him up yourself? That's a steep climb.

You stayed away?

On your sleeve.

I gotta make a report to Fish and Game. I was just wondering, that's all. What'd he do, to shoot himself, I mean?

I never seen a man shot before. Not even in the service. Must be something.

Sure you did.

Twombley sure as hell won't be shooting it again.

I'm fucking out of here.

Open the door, will ya?

Open the door. We're late.

I'm sorry for the screw-up. But I couldn't help it it's too late to go trick-or-treating now. I couldn't help it I had to stop at Penny's for the costume. And you were hungry, remember.

Yeah.

Why do they do that?

Yeah. It's stupid.

Did you do that when you were a kid?

But it's not funny now.

I bet you did lots of bad things.

I just think you used to be bad.

Why? Why not? You know these kids from when you went to school here. It hasn't been that long.

What then?

It's fun.

Some party, huh? Sorry I lost sight of you. I had to step outside for a smoke. You find anybody you know here? There must be some kids you used to know from school. You want to go tomorrow? See your old teachers? Be more fun than hanging out with me all day.

You are home. There are lots of kids you still know here.

Jesus. Listen, Jill, tell you what. Tomorrow morning, you still want to go home, I'll drive you down. I'll get off work or something.

What? You called Mommy? Just now?

Jesus, why?

Come and get you! Shit! It's a damn half hour drive each way. Why didn't you talk to me about it first?

Yeah. Yeah, right, I'm mad. What'd you tell her, for Christ sake?

That's all you got to say? "Yes".

She won't be here for a half hour. Think you can stand it that long?

Sit right there by yourself if you want. Wait for her by yourself. That's fine with me. Just dandy. I'm going downstairs.

Dad.

Are we going in this?

It's pretty old.

Pop?

How about a Big Mac?

What do you want, then?

You can't have nothing, Jill. We need lunch. Mr. Pizza?

I know what Mommy says. I'm in charge today, though.

Nothing, I guess. I guess I can wait till we get home. Maybe we'll stop by Wickham's for a hamburger when we get to Lawford. That suit you? You always like Wickham's.

Please don't cry. Please, honey.

That's illegal, you know.

You're a policeman.

Jill, please, it's alright. Nothing happened.

We're looking for the funniest costume! And the scariest! And the most imaginative! And the best costume of all!

Tomorrow, Gordon.

Jimmy took it. Jack's out hunting with Evan Twombley.

Huh?

You don't want the extra police pay?

What's the hurry?

Huh?

Fuck. Turn it off.  All you heard was there was some kinda accident?

Fuck. You don't know how bad or anything?

I wish you had. I'd rather be deer hunting instead of freezing my ass on that fucking grader.

That must've been Twombley. Jesus. I bet that was Twombley.

Something bugging you?

How you holding up, Wade?

Sorry about the long lunch. My clutch is going out again.

On what you pay me?

What do I have to do for it?

He say anything about the summons I tried to give him? Sonofabitch wouldn't accept it.

You? Why?

That was before Twombley was shot. Before he knew.

I won't. You interested?

You and Mel Gordon?

Me and Jill, we just had a little spat. She felt kind of left out, I guess, from not knowing some of the new kids --

She's grown up some, hasn't she?

You ever come to your father's grave anymore?

We should talk.

See. Get your boots.

No problem. Look, I...

Are you okay, Wade? What was wrong? Why were you holding everyone up?

Did you get his number?

Good. Who?

I still don't understand --

New hat?  Jill's up, I see.

How's she doing?

Don't worry. I can protect my virtue. I mean, c'mon, Wade, give me a break.

You okay?

You okay?

I'm sorry.

You don't mean that.

No you don't. You're pissed, that's all. You ought to cool off for a few days then have a long talk with Lillian. You know? Work it out with her, tell her how you feel. Lillian's not out to get you.

Call me.

Jack's sort of sensitive, I guess. More than most. But he'll be okay in a few weeks.

I heard he was drunk at Toby's last night and got in a fight with Hettie. He drove off without her...

...Jack's turned into one of those men who are permanently angry. He used to be a sweet kid, but it's like, when he found out he couldn't play ball anymore, he changed. Now he's like everyone else.

Money.

Everybody needs money. Except guys like Twombley and that sonofabitch son-in-law of his. People like that.

No, I just know Jack's lying about what happened. He just seemed -- I know that kid, what he's like inside. He's a lot like I was at his age.

No. Not for money. But, if somebody'd given me half a damned excuse -- I was pretty fucked up, you know.

I can see what you looked like as a kid.

Don't you think, do you still think it's a good idea to press this custody thing -- just now?

Oh, Wade.

You've been married twice --

Alright. I'll think about it.

Did you tell them?  That we were coming?

I know your parents.

Are you sure they're home? Did you call?

Strange.

Of course! I would've heard.

What on earth is happening to you? Why are you acting this way?

I heard you talking. You got fired this morning, didn't you?

Going somewhere, Margie?

Don't lie to me. You're leaving me, I can see that.

Have you been heating the house? Not just with the stove.

You're not using it today?

Coffee's perked.

It makes me sad.

Whitehouse. Next time, phone ahead.

I said, 'Next time, phone ahead.'

Moving violation! I just got out of bed and you're telling me you're giving me a goddamn speeding ticket? Now? Are you nuts? Is that it, Whitehouse? You're nuts?

You're talking about a goddamned ticket, from when I passed you at the school where you were deciding to hold up traffic while dreaming of becoming a traffic cop or something?

Doing your fucking job. I know. I watch television too.

Who are you?

He's asleep. We were up very late.

Something about my father?

Take care, Wade.

The sign. It looks like it's spelled wrong or something.

I'm not finding fault. It's a good idea, good for you, good for the town. Real modern too.

Marg!

You talked to Jack?

The fucker shot himself. Ker-bang! That's what it sounds like. Not on purpose. I assume accidental.

The other guy.

CB. Little while ago. One of the boys on the way in picked up Jack on the CB calling for state troopers. I figured you'd know what really happened. The fucking guy kill himself? This Twombley, who the fuck is he, anyhow?

Jillie, you want a cheese grilled sandwich?

Just do it.

Jesus, Pop, how can you stand the cold, dressed like that? Where's Ma?

You remember Margie Fogg?

How you and Ma doing? Haven't seen you in town for a while.

Where's Ma?

Yeah.

Why didn't you call and have the furnace fixed?

Listen, it's no big deal, Pop.

You! By Christ, you -- I know you.  Yeah, you goddamn sonofabitch, I know you. You're a goddamn fucking piece of my heart!

Love! What the fuck do you know about love?

Call it what you want.

Yeah.

Where the Christ you going? You sonofabitch, you leave my fucking truck where it is! I need... Give me the Goddamn keys! I need to get me to town!

Nothing in the fucking house to drink. Not a fucking thing. My house, my money, my truck -- stolen!

Rolfe.

Yeah, brother, look, I was calling cause -- has there been anything on TV in Boston about a hunting accident with a guy named Twombley, Evan Twombley?

Yeah, I know him -- the kid that was with him. Maybe you do too. Jack Hewitt. He works for LaRiviere with me. He's my best friend.

It'll come out Jack lied and the kid'll get hung for it.

No shit.

Well, it was an accident.

Lillian was here. In Lawford.

The night before the shooting.

Picked up Jill. She was supposed to visit for the weekend for Halloween. She wanted to go home.

Jill. I was thinking of getting a lawyer. Maybe you can help me.

Don't think about it. You're exhausted.

Get some sleep.

Haven't you already done a bit of that?

Pointless to stand around in church with nothing to do, I guess.

Well, do you still plan to get married?

I want to let the gas run out. I don't want the bastard driving drunk, and he's always drunk now. After, we'll hide the keys.

I guess it was an accident, like everybody thinks.

Find them everywhere. 

Which is?

Then who shot him?

Motive. You gotta have a motive.

Who'd pay him that kind of money? Not the mob. They got their own guys. Specialists.

I don't know. You tell me.

Yeah, the guy with the BMW I told you about. I did, didn't I?

So Mel Gordon wouldn't want a professional hit. That'd make the feds dig deeper. He wants an accident.

It's too neat. Things ain't that neat. It makes me mad. That somebody can pay to kill somebody, his own father-in-law, and not be punished for it. Don't that piss you off?

Right's right, goddamnit! Don't you care what's right?

I was thinking about that story you told me, about Pop and chopping the firewood out of the ice and after.

I hate to disappoint you, but I don't think it happened.

It may have happened, but not the way you said.

It wasn't me. I wasn't there, but I heard about it. When I heard about it, it was about Elbourne.

And Elbourne and Mom took you to the doctor and told him you fell from the hay loft.

I remember clearly cause when I heard I became real careful around Pop. I was a careful child and I became a careful adult, but at least I wasn't afflicted by that man's violence.

Then you accidentally see your body, or your face, or whatever, and you don't know who the hell it belongs to. Strange. It's the business with the old man, I know, and how incredibly pissed I was at him, and also chasing Jack Hewitt like that, and the Goddamned truck going through the ice, not to mention Margie's being so upset -- one thing on top of another.

To help, Jack, of course -- and to nail those sonsofbitches, the Two Gordons. That's what Alma calls them. Jesus, Rolfe, whose side are you on?

Hey Joey, how `bout a cocoa, double whip cream.

Mom, just this once, give it a rest.

When I write my memoirs I think I'll devote an entire chapter to the cocoa aboard Air Force One.

Mom?

Daddy. Daddy, please...

You're one of Stravanavitch's men.

The woman you shot. She was my friend.

Fuck off, you stupid asshole.

He didn't leave us.

Oooooh, I'm good.

How was...  ...the ballet?

Alice!

Daddy...

How you doing, sweetie?

Oh NY god... oh my god... oh my god...

There they are!

The Americans say they are escorting a damaged plane. Our pilots confirm they are surrounding a 747.

It's some kind of trick... a preliminary airstrike in response to our troop movement.

The pilot says it is does not have the markings of a commercial jet.

Pop it open. There should be a red switch, toggle it up.

It's cut.

Mr. President, it's an honor. Now with your permission can we lead you the fuck out of here.

Put your pilot on.

Who's flying the fucking plane?

Two and three are heading toward the Boeing.

How we doing, Colonel?

Uh, we got a problem here.

No. We're losing fuel and my rudder's not responding.

Aw, man. You're torn up pretty bad out here, sir. Do you have any elevater control.

They aren't answering their hails.

They've got no chutes. They can't control the plane, their engines are failing and they're losing fuel.

Sir, you threw out page two.

It was a good ad-lib, sir.

Apparently taking uzis away from sixth graders isn't as popular as we thought it'd be.  Representative Taylor is working on a compromise.

The Iraqi ambassador is claiming it's just an exercise.

General Greely says it looks like the Middle East.

But they start executing hostages in

They still have the President, it's past their deadline and they haven't called. What do you think it means?

The Chief Justice? What on earth for?

Special Agent Gibbs. You helped do this?

Why?

You're duty to what? The country you served doesn't exist anymore.

Air Force One, this is AF-135-RA. We have been instructed to refuel your plane.

Please change course to Zero Seven Four and drop to eighteen thousand feet. Over.

Air Force One, please reduce speed to 250 knots.

That's affirmative.

We've already been inspected.

The rest of the secret service?

Who did this?

Psychology. They're trying to unnerve us.

How?

We've stopped dumping... but we've only got about twenty minutes of fuel left.

Not even close. Hell, we can't even make Syria or Iraq.

Over the Black Sea. I can probably get us to Turkey or Georgia.

Tower, Air Force One has been boarded.

Romeo Tango Zulu, do you have the President? Over.

This is Romeo Tango Zulu changing call signs.  Tower, alert air traffic, Romeo Tango Zulu is now Air Force One.  This is Air Force One... The President is safe onboard.

Up on the upper deck is the cockpit and the Mission Communication Center. The MCC, as we call it, can place clear and secure phone calls to anywhere on earth.  We're linked to a network of military and civilian satellites and ground stations.  We could run the country or run a war from there if we had to.

You don't know the half of it.  Did you know this entire plane is shielded from radiation?  We could fly through a mushroom cloud completely unharmed if necessary.

And all these rooms here?

Here's a press kit.  I'll let you guys get comfortable and once we're airborne I'll be able to schedule the interviews.

I'm responsible for Press Relations for the Flight Office.

You're pointing a gun at me.

Now, or he dies, please.

Leave my daughter alone.

What do you know of my husband?

My husband is a very courageous man.

Do you have to be so brutal?

Why? Do you enjoy it?

Shall I begin by executing the President's daughter? She's right here.

Nor will there be. My husband does not negotiate with terrorists.

The world is such a dangerous place and we can't always protect our children.

Four...

You got what you wanted. You going to release us now?

She isn't a part of this. This is between you and me.

This administration does not negotiate with terrorists.

Stop.

Yes, I'll do it.  Just leave my family alone.

The taste of defeat is bitter, no?

There goes your ride.

No you won't. You'll compromise... like always.

Twenty minutes?

Madame Vice president. We have an options paper.  chandler takes the options paper, waves off Lee, and reads it as she talks.

Finally, we can bargain.

The northern border's gotten a bit hairy. Their MiGs are playing tag with our Tomcats and our boys are just itching to engage.

Mr. Caidwell, the ground's a few miles away. How do you propose getting us from here to there?

Get `em ready.  You... come with me.

I'll not going without my family.

Sir, we stay with the President.

May I speak to you for a moment?

Don't.  I know spin control when I feel it.

I miss you. And I miss her.

Look on the bright side, hon. Shep here thinks I'll be a one termer.

I don't know why you stayed.

Call Petrov...  I'll be back.

The fax machines.

Where are we sending it?

Someone should give you a raise.

Did they say anything about my family?

and if that means negotiating...

Please, Mr. President. You're going to get yourself killed. Is that your solution?

What's going on?

Where's my family?

White House switchboard. How may I direct your call.

Sir, the President does not call this particular number. So whoever you are get a life, before I have this call traced.

Thank you for calling the white House...

*                     CBS said they'll give us four minutes.  They thought the Russian was a nice touch.

You wanna knock of f?

With all due respect, sir, maybe you should give them this one.  Your numbers are still pretty low and you called in a lot of chips to nail Stravanavitch.

*                     We could always put you in a duck blind with a twelve gauge.  The second amendment types'll love that.

Other way around, sir.

It's bait.  Don't take it.

Mr. President, how the hell did you get on board?

Shepherd.

My god. I think that was a MiG.

Iraq, sir. We're over Iraq.

Shit.

Twenty five minutes. They should be here any moment.

WE'RE HOOKED!

Commissioner, we both know the Mercury shuttle needs another month of pre-launch testing.

And what do the boys on the board know about safety, Commissioner?  Let <u>me</u> talk to them.

That's right, Commissioner.  Senselessly murdered just minutes ago.

I wonder how your boys in Washington are going to take this one.

What's the story?

Kruger, Sagittarius.

Did you feel that?

Felt like a large asteroid.

What is it, Mary?

Oveur.

Shut down accelerators.

We seem to have a malfunction in disposal unit four, sir.

Sir, I've got an overload in disposal unit four.

Dunn.

It's got to be stopped!

Ted, you're overworked.  You've been flying yourself into the ground.

Let's relax tonight, just the two of us. I'll make a quiet Italian dinner just the way you like it, with spaghetti.

Eat this spaghetti, Ted.  It'll make you feel a lot better.

Elaine, when are you going to realize Simon Kurtz put me in here to get me out of the way.

His name's David Stockman.  He's been here twenty years, that's all he says.

No goodbyes, Elaine.  Just go.

That's the way I want it.  Just turn the radio on and go.

Ted!  What are you...?

Ted, we're taking off!

What are you doing, Ted?

Ted.

Elaine.

Elaine, we have to go back.

The word is sick.  Ted -- very, very, very sick.

I'd use the word insane.

Elaine, what's going on?

Elaine, I'm going back there.  Just hold onto that stick and try to control this hunk of tin as best you can.

Ted, we've only got ten minutes.

Kurtz was the one who got us into this mess in the first place.  You people knew this ship wasn't ready to fly.  You played God with over a hundred lives, Kruger, and for what -- the prestige of your precious space program.

Well, Elaine, this might be it if those guys on the ground don't think of something.

Simon just ejected!

You mean...

What will happen to him, Ted?

Are you afraid?

We've blown the computer!  Elaine!  Set course change!

Ted, the lever!

So you see, our task isn't made any easier by Ted's refusal to admit that he's sick.

You can eat balanced meals, exercise, and take Geritol.

You can be gentle with him, Elaine.  He's been working out a lot of his aggressions here in the garden.

The brain is an amazingly complex organ, Elaine.

For the best little computer officer on the Mercury mission.

Elaine!  Ted's a danger to himself, he's a threat to this mission and his behavior does absolutely nothing to promote peace in the Middle East.

Meet me onboard, sweetheart.  I have to pick up a few things at the drugstore.

Have you got it straightened out now?

Simon, I'm going to check ROK's secondary readout unit.

Simon, what's happening?!

Can't we change course?

My career is shot.

Elaine, ask ROK for a field interference scan.  Those sun spots might give us a problem with our communications.

I don't think we have any alternative, Captain.

Roger.

Intermitant failure in scan mode "R". Analyze.

That doesn't make sense.  Repeat analysis.

Elaine, I'm sorry about that little outburst a moment ago.

Can I say something of a personal nature to you?

Request; comprehensive electrical systems check.

Request; life support systems check.

Request; self-analysis of ROK hardware and software systems regarding behavioral changes.

I sure an glad they let Scraps ride up here with us.

Do you think things will be a lot different on Mercury, Dad?

How many kids get a chance to live on another planet.

Come on up, Jimmy.  Say, that's some puppy.  What's his name?

Can I hold him?

He's a boy dog.

Take this, Joey.  It's my last few bucks. You'll need a hot meal when you get there.

Okay, Joey.  The Doc says you gotta relax. This hospital in Des Moines is the best sex clinic in the country.

Joe, you don't want to blow that thing and kill all these innocent people.

That's right, Joe.  Now, no one's going to hurt you and no one has to know what's wrong with you.

A couple eggs and juice would be nice, Mary.  Over.

No.  Poached.  Over.

That's how I want them.  Poached.  Over.

Captain, the coffee machine is jammed and I don't like it.

Which passenger is Joe Salucci?

He's carrying a bomb.

No, a bomb.  Now, as discreetly as possible, I want you to move the passengers into the lounge.

Captain Oveur?

Good to be aboard, gentlemen.

Whenever your're ready, Captain.

You folks need any help?

It's a privilege to meet you, sir, I'm familiar with all your work.

Ah, yes, the Institute, I'm familiar with it.

No, dammit.  It's a matter of life or death.

All right, it's a matter of death.

Are you on the Mercury mission?

You're seeing bugs where they don't exist, Striker.

You're tired, Striker, overworked.  That wiring meets all the safety specifications.

Striker.

That damn computer has taken over.  I'm getting out.

Don't talk to me about Elaine.  Outta my way!

Excuse me, are you alright?  I noticed you talking to yourself.  I'm a nurse.  Can I be of some help?

You don't have to thank me, I'm a nurse. This is my father, Dr. Barrington.

Yes.  He's dying <u>a-n-d</u> wants to be buried on Mercury.

You've been hurt.

Do you want to talk about it.

No.  I mean your relationship.

Not if the people change together in relation to that love.

Then the relationship remains the same and the love changes only when there's change in the two people who share that love.

No.  It's hard to L-A-U-G-H when your father's dying.

I happened to be passing, and I thought you might like some corfee.

Ah, won't you sit down?

No, thank you. I take it black. Like my men.

Well, it really wasn't a vacation. You see, I'm a teacher in the New York City school system, and I was attending a seminar on visual aids to education. Are you from L.A.?

But I think it's time we stopped talking about me. A woman like you -- why haven't you ever married?

I know the answer -- Career. A smart woman like you became so involved in your work, you didn't have time for marriage.

You know, here we are having coffee together, and discussing education and business and economy...and we don't even know each other's names...full names I mean.

I'm sure we'll both make it...but just in case one of us...well, is there a message you'd like me to give someone?

Just in case I don't have a chance to say goodbye, I want you to know that I haven't spent so many pleasant hours for many years.

Hello, I'm Paul Carey from the airline. I'm here to pick up Captain Kramer.

Shep, sit...sit! So, I understand you've got a real emergency down there.

Yeah, something like that, but as I say, they didn't have time to tell me very much.

Surely you can't be serious.

Elaine, I haven't time to put this gently, so I'll be very direct. Everyone of us on this plane is in a desperate situation. Mister Striker is the only hope we've got.

...safe and sound and free to pursue a life of religious fulfillment.

Will the hospital equipment be at the airport?

I won't deceive you, Mister Striker. We're running out of time.

George Zipp said that?

Captain, how soon can we land?

Can't you take a guess?

You can't take a guess for another two hours?

Sir. Excuse me, sir. I'm sorry to have to wake you. Are you a doctor?

We have some passengers who are very sick. Could you come and take a look at them?

It's a big building with patients. But that's not important right now. Tell the Captain I must speak to him.

What was it we had for dinner tonight?

What did he have?

Doctor Rumack, Mister Hammen ate fish. And Randy says there are five more cases, and they ate fish, too.

Just how serious is it, doctor?

No. No one that I know of.

Elaine!

I came home early and found your note. I guess you meant for me to read it later. Elaine, I've got to talk to you.

I know things haven't been right for a long time, but it'll be different. If you'll just be patient, I can work things out.

Don't you feel anything for me at all any more?

Look, you'll be back in town tomorrow night. We'll have dinner -- talk it over.

Elaine, not yet. I promise you I really can change.

You know I haven't been able to get near an airplane since the war. And even if I could, they wouldn't hire me because of my war record.

It's the truth. What's hurt you the most is your record since the war. Different cities, different jobs, and not one of them shows you can accept any real responsibility.

Ted, what are you doing here?

What's the matter?

Oh, Ted, please be careful. I worry about you so much.

Elaine, just hear me out. I know things haven't been right for a long time. But it will be different...like it was in the beginning. Remember?

You got a telegram from head­quarters today.

Is it? Because of my mistake six men didn't return from that raid.

I wish I could say the same for George Zipp.

What's his problem?

Ted! What are you doing? You can't fly this plane!

Rain.

Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.

It's a damn good thing he doesn't know how much I hate his guts.

Rats! I've lost number three.

But Ted, you're the only...

Ted...

I wanted you to know -- now -- I'm very proud.

See them, Elaine?

We have a visitor.

We'd better get back now.

Hey, we've been waiting for you. A little bit late tonight.

Airsick?

Oh, Bill, I'm going to miss you so much.

Good-bye, darling.

And get that finger out of your ear. You don't know where that finger's been! Gunderson?

Did you decide on a runway yet?

Eight miles. Turn right to heading zero eight niner.

He's all over the place! Nine hundred feet up to thirteen hundred feet! What an asshole!

He's right on the heading.

Jack, isn't that Fred Bliffert over there in the blue turtleneck? Maybe he's on our flight to Chicago.

Oh, I can't stand it.

How ya doing, honey?

Wait a minute. I know you. You're Kareem Abdul Jabbar. You play basketball for the Los Angeles Lakers!

You <u>are</u> Kareem. I've seen you play. My Dad's got season tickets!

I'm an airline pilot.  Ah, Clarence, according to my calculations, with this tailwind we ought to be able to make up an additional fifteen minutes over the Rockies.

Denver Control, this is Flight two-zero- niner intersecting Victor Airway seven- niner-niner.

We are turning left to a heading of zero- niner-niner.

Hi!

I'm Lisa. Oh, you have a guitar!

Oh, I'd love to.

Would either of you like another cup of coffee?

Well, the doctor will be with you in just a moment. One thing: do you know what he had for dinner?

Roger.

Roger.

We have clearance, Clarence.

Do you want me to check the weather, Clarence?

Excuse me, Sister?

Could I borrow your guitar? I thought I might be able to cheer her up.

Excuse me, sir. Would you like some coffee before we serve dinner?

Excuse me, sir. There's been a little problem in the cockpit and I was wondering...

Well, I flew in the war, but that was a long time ago. I wouldn't know anything about it.

Mr. Striker, the passengers are ready.

Oooh.  Hardball.  That sounds interesting.  Are you going to strike me?  You could tie me up and then do whatever you want with me... I've got my own ropes.

Look, I don't know where Mr. Strader might be.  He comes and he goes.

I know... Why don't you hang around for a while, let me entertain you? It's Matt, right?  Now tell me the truth, have you ever... made it... with one of us?

There's lots of things I haven't done, but his ain't high on the list.  Don't take it personally.

I like my horizons narrow.

You okay?

We are with the Police Department. This is Sergeant Sykes, and I am--

He's not here.  Why ask me?

In there.

So what've you got on Tuggle's killers?

Well, if it isn't Detective Jetson. Forget you hip waders, big guy?

Yes, I heard about poor Warren. Tragic.

Move a finger, Harcourt, and you're history...

He didn't recognize me.

Kill them both.

... and we work my hours.  I'll do the driving, you do the paperwork. You gotta learn it so you might as well do it all.

What's that?  Look, Jetson.  Get this straight in your head.  We're not pals, we're not married, and we ain't gonna take long moonlight walks together... We're just partners.  And don't call me Sergeant.  Call me Sykes... or Matt if you have to.

Man, somebody really hung one on you!  I've heard some good ones for you guys... Humphrey Bogart, Harley Davidson.  I guess the people at immigration got a little punchy after a while, coming up with names for a quarter of a million of you. You weren't at the back of the line, were you, George?

Anyway, what's it matter to you if we think it's funny, right?  Whatta you care?

Terrific.  A real pillar of the community.  Was Hubley missing anything when they found him?  Was he ripped off?

The guys at the mini-mart last night made a half-assed stab at the money in the till -- but I don't think that's what they were there for.  I think we got us a couple'a executions on our hands, George...

Look, you want to fit in here, right?  You want to learn how to get along?

What is wrong?

Well... yes, quite possibly.

Yes... no, it is not unreasonable. Although I--

What's this?  What's going on?

Nothing?

What is this?

Well... Yeah, it's rubber.  It stretches.

A large number of my people were hired by refineries because the methane fumes are not harmful to us. My spouse's brother is one.

I believe I should interview the widow alone.

Mrs. Porter is not taking her husband's death well.

A week ago two men came to see her husband.  After they left, he was very frightened.  She identified one of the men from a photo I showed her.  It was Hubley.

She didn't know him.  But she said her son might.

Why did you do it?

Agree to work with me?  You don't like me... you don't like any of us. You have nothing but contempt for us.  And yet you become an outcast from your club of detectives by making me your partner...

Who said that?

Your name wouldn't happen to be Porter, would it?

Back off, George.

Tell me.

You know that guy?

How could a straight-arrow like you ever pick a roommate like him?

If I may make a suggestion... We have different weak spots than you do.  Next time, a blow to the nerve plexus under the arm, here, will produce the effect I think you were looking for.

I don't think I could ever learn to read that shit.  How long did it take you to learn English?

Which one is that?  Raw what?

So what was that other word for Human... Slow ka?

And what was that one about my mother?  That was a good one.

I believe he is probably lying.

Yeah... I know the routine.

Was.  Divorced.

Your home is quite disordered.  I thought perhaps you had been burglarized when I walked in.

Human children can be very beautiful.  Getting married?  Congratulations. You will be taking Sunday off, then...

... and so, and so the doctor says, "If this is the thermometer, then where'd I leave the pen?"  You're not... you don't think that's funny?  George, work with me, I always get a laugh with that one. Look, if the doctor's got the thermometer in his hand, then where's his pen gotta be?

Your health...

There is so much our two peoples don't understand about each other.

I hope you can understand how special your world is... how unique a people you humans are.  So it us all the more painful and confusing to us that so few of you seem capable of living up the the ideals you set for yourselves.

Where'd you get this?!!

She's going to divorce me.

Stop the car.

Please, I must get out here.

It's all right, George.  It's cool. Just wait here, all right?  I'll be back in a coupla minutes.

What was that about?

No secrets, goddammit!  You don't hold back from me.  Whatever is going on, you're gonna tell me now!

The hell it isn't, when somebody wires up enough C-4 explosive to my car to turn me into pink mist!  That Slag was on something, and not sour milk, either?  Am I right?  TELL ME!  What is it?

How potent?

Jesus, this is major.  Why didn't you tell me sooner? Why'd you hold out on me?

George, uh... you're gonna break his little chest bones...

George, c'mon -- lighten up.  It's a beauty of a case.  Don't sweat it -- we got him by the short hairs. He ain't gonna make any more of the shit.



Shit!

What's this about, George?  I know that look.

No!  We must do this alone.

What is this?!

Harcourt is dead.

I never thought I'd say this, but -- for once in my life I think I'm willing to wait for back-up.

But there's no more drug.

How do I look?

Casull .454 Magnum.  You're talking twice the impact energy of .44 Magnum hot loads.

Mr. Hubley was an all right guy -- and a damn good manager.  The men liked him.  I'm really gonna have to scramble to fill his shoes.

To be honest, it's hard to say.  I hate to admit it but -- they all still kinda look alike to me.

Wait.  You know who it looks like? Yeah.  Anderson.  Uh... James Anderson.  He isn't in today.  He took the afternoon off.

That where Anderson worked?

Don't piss him off, O'Neal.  When he gets like this, I can't control him. I've seen this before.  He got like this once -- I saw him jerk a guy's spine out and show it to him. Nothing I could do.  I hadda go throw up.

Here's Hubley.  Left Quarantine on November thirtieth, relocated first to Riverside, then moved to Los Angeles early in February the following year.  Field of expertise: chemical manufacturing.  Looks like he passed up several other better paying jobs waiting for that one at the refinery.

Released December one.  He and his wife moved first to Modesto, then Coalinga, California -- wherever that is -- settled in L.A. in April.  Field of expertise: organic chemical engineering.  He and his wife have one child, a son.

Jesus, are the questions too tough for you already?  Let's try again--  Is your name Porter?

One of the two men was Hubley, right?  What about the other one? Did you know him?

Yeah, I heard of it.

You know I've been over all this with Fedorchuk and Alterez this morning...

No I.D. on him and -- well, you know, no fingerprints -- so it could be tough.  Your buddies this morning went through the mug book but couldn't make a facial match.

You took this gut out, too, didn't you?

Lucky for you, you got him in both of his... well, what we loosely refer to as... hearts.

Oh, here's an extra headshot if you need one.  We're just about to start cutting in.  You're welcome to stick around if you want.  It's really fascinating stuff.

What kind of test?

Yeah, Sykes?

You are to have nothing to do with the investigation into Bill Tuggle's death.  You know that.  Leave that for Fedorchuk.

Granger and Pitts are already on it.

Hope their plumbing's the same.

What?

Goddammit, Tug -- I want to see Kristin get married, okay?  But--

Does that look at all suspicious to you?

You got your vest?

Watch the driver.  I'm going for a better angle on the door.

Get outta there!

This floor's freezing.

Whoooah!  No shit?  I'm impressed.

Hey, 'Top.'  What's the op?

Can't lock up...

...that's better.  Pan it around a bit.

Set down sixty meters this side of the telemetry mast.  Immediate dust off on my 'clear,' then stay on station.

I've isolated a neuro-muscular toxin responsible for the paralysis.  It seems to be metabolizing.  He should wake up soon.

Which would mean lots of those parasites, right?  One for each person...over a hundred at least.

But these things come from eggs...so where are all the eggs coming from.

You're saying one of those things lays all the eggs?

Could it be intelligent?

That's it.  See it?  Emergency venting.

And it's too late to shut it down?

I'll go.

I'm really the only one qualified to remote-pilot the ship anyway. Believe me, I'd prefer not to.  I may be synthetic but I'm not stupid.

HOW MUCH TIME?

Ripley...

Have they located my daughter yet?

Is she...?

You read my deposition...it's complete and accurate.

I get the picture.

No.  There's no way!

What about you?  What's your interest in this?

That's right.

If I go.

Yes, and I've read it.  You wake up every night, sheets soaking, the same nightmare over and over...

Yello?  Oh, Ripley.  Hi...

You never said anything about an android being here!  Why not?

I hope you're right.  I really do.

They're right under the primary heat exchangers.

That's not what I mean.  Gorman, if your men have to use their weapons in there, they'll rupture the cooling system.

No good.  How do we know it'll effect their biochemistry?  I say we take off and nuke the entire site from orbit.  It's the only way to be sure.

Well, I mean...I know this is an emotional moment, but let's not make snap judgments.  Let's move cautiously.  First, this physical installation had a substantial dollar value attached to it --

This is clearly an important species we're dealing with here. We can't just arbitrarily exterminate them --

What rank?  I believe Corporal Hicks has authority here.

Those specimens are worth millions to the bio-weapons division.  Now, if you're smart we can both come out of this heroes.  Set up for life.

Now, wait a second --

You sent them out there and you didn't even warn them, Burke. Why didn't you warn them?

Look, we don't know what's going on out there.  It may just be a down transmitter.  But if it's not, I want you there...as an advisor.  That's all.

These Colonial Marines are some tough hombres, and they're packing state-of-the-art firepower. Nothing they can't handle...right, Lieutenant?

Still nothing from the colony?

Looks like you company can write off its share of this colony.

What's he scanning for?

We're talking thermonuclear explosion.

How may drops is this for you, Lieutenant?

Hold at forty.  Slow circle of the complex.

One of us?

Where are your parents?  You have to try...

What is it?

So.

GET THEM OUT OF THERE!  DO IT NOW!

How do you feel?

At ease.  I'm sorry we didn't have time to brief before we left Gateway but...

Yes, Hicks?

All right, the area's secured. Let's go in and see what their computer can tell us.  First team head for operations. Hudson, see if you can get their CPU on line.  Hicks, meet me at the south lock by the up-link tower...

Sir, the CPU is on-line.

Hah!  Stop your grinnin' and drop your linen!  Found 'em.

We're not making that out too well.  What is it?

Save it.

Let's get the fuck out of here!

Well that's great!  That's just fucking great, man.  Now what the fuck are we supposed to do, man? We're in some real pretty shit now!

Outstanding.  Then all we need's a deck of cards.  All right, let's move like we got a purpose.

Maybe we got 'em demoralized.

The corner!  Ready?

Well you're not reading it right!

Let's go!  Let's go!

Removed surgically before embryo implantation.  Subject:  Marachuk, John L.   Died during procedure.  They killed him getting it off.

How long after we're declared overdue can we expect a rescue?

All right.  There's a fire door at this end.  The first thing we do is put a remote sentry in the tunnel and seal that door.

They're in the approach corridor.

Now many?

Newt time then can walk right up and knock.

Hicks, I'm not going to wind up like those others.  You'll take care of it won't you, it if comes to that?

What's this?

Wait a minute.  We'd know about it.

You know, Burke, I don't know which species is worse.  You don't see them screwing each other over for a fucking percentage.

It's game time.

They learned.  They cut the power and avoided the guns.  They must have found another way in, something we missed.

No!  No!  She's alive!  We have to --

Hicks, don't let him leave.

Ellen.

Somebody said alien...she thought they said illegal alien and signed up.

Oh, man.  And I was gettin' short, too!  Four more weeks and out. Now I'm gonna buy it on this fuckin' rock.  It ain't half fair, man!

Sounds like you, Hicks.

Looks like it stung him.

You can't help them.  Right now they're being cocooned just like the others.

Man, we're not going to make it seventeen hours!  Those things are going to come in here, just like they did before, man... they're going to come in here and get us, man, long before...

Thanks.

Well then somebody's just going to have to go out there.  Take a portable terminal and go out there and plug in manually.

They cut the power.

This signal's weird...must be some interference or something. There's movement all over the place...

Range twenty meters.

Fifteen meters.

Twelve meters.  Man, this is a big fucking signal.  Ten meters.

Nine meters.  Eight.

You remember you sent some wildcatters out to that plateau, out past the Ilium range, a couple days ago?

There's a guy on the horn, mom-and-pop survey team.  Says he's homing on something and wants to know if his claim will be honored.

So what do I tell this guy?

And how are we today?

Bad dreams again?  Do you want something to help you sleep?

Casey.  She's my only friend.

I don't want you for a friend.

Newt.  Look at me...Newt.  I won't leave you.  I promise.

Cross my heart.

I was the best at the game. I knew the whole maze.

Yeah, you know.  In the walls, under the floor.  I was the ace.  I could hide better than anybody.

Ripley...she doesn't have bad dreams because she's just a piece of plastic.

Yes, there are, aren't there.

Well, some kids can't handle it like you can.

No, it's different, honey.

Yes.  A little girl.

Don't go!  Please.

Newt.  Newt, wake up.

Mommy...I mean, Ripley...I'm scared.

Burke!  Open the door!

Come on.  Crawl faster.

This way.  Come on, we're almost there!

I knew you'd come.

Are we going to sleep now?

Can we dream?

Look, I told you...

Look, I can see where this is going.  But I'm telling you those things exist.  Back on that planetoid is an alien ship and on that ship are thousands of eggs.  Thousands. Do you understand?  I suggest you find it, using the flight recorder's data.  Find it and deal with it -- before one of your survey teams comes back with a little surprise...

How many colonists?

A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish. A willing, billing, lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish. Be my most tasty little dish! Be my most tasty little dish!

A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish. A willing, billing, lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish.

A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish. A willing, billing, lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish.

Follow me, please. The Archbishop would like a word.

Well, I think that went off remarkably well, don't you?

These Viennese certainly know good music when they hear it.

Well, I heard you met Herr Mozart.

And he's been commissioned to write an opera. Is it true?

Is there a part for me?

Where?

What's that?

Oh. Well perhaps you could introduce us anyway.

What does he look like?

Why?

Did you know? Had you heard?

The marriage!

How was I? Tell me honestly.

What did you think of the music?

Katherina! I'll tell you what I'm going to do. I'm going to write another aria for you. Something even more amazing for the second act. I have to get some water. Her mother is lying on the stage.

No, she's fine.

Is she a good fuck?

No, no, no, no. You can't take him away now. This is his night. Won't you introduce us, Wolfgang?

No! I won't have him back.

Hardly.

Your son is an unprincipled, spoiled, conceited brat.

And how will you make him keep it?

Why what, sir?

If His Grace is not satisfied with me, he can dismiss me.

No, Your Grace! I mean with all humility, no. I would rather you dismissed me. It's obvious I don't satisfy.

I've come to dinnnnnner!

In the pot, I have got a good dinner. Not a sausage or stew, but a singer. Not a sausage or stew but a singer. Is the treat that I'll eat for my meat!

What is it?

Where?

Now?

Why?

Stop it!

No! No! No!

Where?

Why not?

That's stupid.

Do you think that's funny?

Sra-I'm-sick. Sick - kiss I'm - my Kiss my! Sra-I'm-sick - Kiss my arse!

No, I'm not playing this game.

No!

Tish-I'm tee. What's that?

Tish-I'm-tee.

Yes.

Excuse me, Wolfi. Mama is not feeling very well. Can we leave now?

I think you're mad! You're really mad!

No, they will not. I know how things work in this city.

Yes!

How are we going to live, Wolfi? Do you want me to go into the streets and beg?

All they want to see is your work. What's wrong with that?

Stop it now. Stop it. I've brought some friends to meet you. They're next door waiting. Do we have anything to eat? They're all starving.

What's the matter with you?

Sssh. What is it? Tell me.

My Stanzi - look at her! Isn't she beautiful? Come on now, confess, Papa. Could you want a prettier girl for a daughter?

May I offer you some tea, Herr Mozart?

Wolfi!

There's a young girl to see you.

I don't know.

She won't talk to me. She says she has to speak to you.

Look, old man, you stay out of this. We spend a fortune on you, more than we can possibly afford, and all you do is criticize, morning to night. And then you think you can -

We'll have a little party. Come in. Come in. You know Herr Schikaneder?  This is! a very nice girl.

Yes, my love?

What?

Half the receipts! Stanzi!

You're not going to do this?

When? We need money now. Either he pays now, or you don't do it.

I don't trust this man. And I didn't like what he did with your opera. It was common.

What's that? Oh!  Who gave you this? How much is it? Wolfi, who gave you this?

Why not?

No. Don't answer it!

This is my wife, Stanzi. I've been sick, but I'm all right now. Aren't I?

Give me one reason I can understand.

Why not?

Excellency!

How charming.  But why did he not come himself?

I will look at them, of course, the moment I can. It will be an honour. Please give him my warmest.

I'm afraid I'm not at leisure this very moment. Just leave them with me. I assure you they will be quite safe.

Really?

I see.

Thank you very much, Your Excellency.

Originals?

These are originals?

Tomorrow night I dine with the Emperor. One word from me and the post is his.

Come back tonight.

Alone.

Some service deserves service in return. No?

It's a post all Vienna seeks. If you want it for your husband, come tonight.

I do apologize for this afternoon. I behaved like a silly girl. Where shall we go?

What are you doing here?

Why you?

Well, thank you very much. You can go now.

This is not his handwriting.

I regret we have no servants to show you out, Herr Salieri. Respect my wish and go.

How much will you pay him?

Am I interrupting something?

Where's our friend?

Look, you little clown, do you know how many people I've hired for you? Do you know how many people are waiting?

I'm paying these people. Do you realize that?

Oh yes? And what's so intelligent about writing a Requiem?

You're mad! She's mad, Wolfi.

I see that you're expecting.

When, may I ask?

He's adorable!

Behold!

Behold!

Let us pass, please! Let us pass at once! We're with the Emperor.

Do you know who I am?  This is my daughter. I am Frau Weber. We are favoured guests!

I am sorry, Madame, but no! I cannot let anyone pass.

Upstairs.

I've heard about you for ages! I thought you must be an old man.

It's such an honour for us to have you here, Herr Mozart. And for Gertrude.

I said play!

What a strange young man.

Really?

Just one year.

I was. But she quite outgrew the little I could show her.

I think it is an interesting notion to keep Mozart in Vienna, Majesty. It should really infuriate the Archbishop beyond measure - if that is your Majesty's intention.

What a charming idea. May I see?

Delightful, Court Composer. Would you permit me to play it as he comes in?

And here is our illustrious Court Composer, Herr Salieri.

Good morning, Court Composer. This is my niece, the Princess Elizabeth.

Oh, Your Majesty, it would be such a tremendous honour!

An interesting idea, Majesty. But -

You already commissioned an opera from Mozart.

Yes, of course. My concern is to protect you from any suspicion of favouritism.

I'm sure there is a way, Majesty. Some kind of a little contest. I could perhaps put together a small Committee, and I could see to it naturally that it will select according to Your Majesty's wishes.

Sire.

I don't think you understand me, Court Composer.

Why not?

Majesty, I don't like to talk against a fellow musician.

As a matter of fact, one of my own pupils - a very young singer - told me she was - er - well!

Do you like this, Salieri?

Your Majesty!

Oh, thank you.

And now he has returned the compliment. Herr Salieri composed that March of Welcome for you.

Majesty!

Why so?

Yes, where?

Keep it, Sire, if you want to. It is already here in my head.

It is new, it is, isn't it, Sire?

And German?

So then you like it? You really like it, Your Majesty?

What do you mean, Sire?

I don't understand. There are just as many notes, Majesty, as are required. Neither more nor less.

Excuse me, but how old are you?

Bravo, Mozart. Most charming. Yes, indeed. Clever man.

May I introduce my father? He is on a short visit here and returning very soon to Salzburg. He would so much like to kiss your hand. It would make his whole stay so memorable for him.

Mozart, are you aware I have declared the French play of Figaro unsuitable for our theatre?

Yet we hear you are making an opera from it. Is this true?

It is not your place to ask questions. Is it true?

Would you tell me why?

Mozart, I am a tolerant man. I do not censor things lightly. When I do, I have good reason. Figaro is a bad play. It stirs up hatred between the classes. In France it has caused nothing but bitterness. My own dear sister Antoinette writes me that she is beginning to be frightened of her own people. I do not wish to see the same fears starting here.

But, Majesty, this is just a frolic. It's a piece about love.

But it's new, it's entirely new. It's so new, people will go mad for it. For example, I have a scene in the second act - it starts as a duet, just a man and wife quarreling. Suddenly the wife's scheming little maid comes in unexpectedly - a very funny situation. Duet turns into trio. Then the husband's equally screaming valet comes in. Trio turns into quartet. Then a stupid old gardener - quartet becomes quintet, and so on.  On and on, sextet, septet, octet! How long do you think I can sustain that?

Forgive me, Majesty. I'm a vulgar man. But I assure you, my music is not.

Ah-ha. Well then, we should make some effort to acquire him. We could use a good German composer in Vienna, surely?

Ah-ha. What do you say, Chamberlain?

Yes, sir.

Well, what do you have for me today?

Why are you here?

Do you always live like this?

She's very tired, poor creature. You know me: I'm a real pig. It's not so easy cleaning up after me.

Oh we could, if we wanted to, but Stanzi won't hear of it. She wants to do everything herself.

It couldn't be better.

Who? Who says that? Now that's a malicious lie!

Yes.

What's that?

Why not?

You don't have secrets from me.

Thank you. That'll be fine. Don't spend any money on me.

No, really!

I'm tired of this game. Please play without me.

Papa, is this your idea?

Are you playing a trick on me?

Never mind. You won't have to do anything for me ever again. I'm leaving!

Father -

Ah-ha! Siena macaroons - my favourites. Give my best thanks to the baker.

Thank you. Are you well today, Fraulein Lorl?

Madame Cavalieri is here for her lesson, sir.

Oh, thank you, sir.

Not that I've seen.

Oh, yes, sir, all day long. He never leaves the house until evening. He just sits there, writing and writing. He doesn't even eat.

I think I've found out about the money, sir.

Where does he work?

Now calm yourself. Calm. What's the matter with you?

Why? What has happened?

What medicine?

Where?

Opera? Opera!

That's right.

What?

Are you saying that someone is paying you to be our maid and doesn't want us to know who he is?

Sssh!

What did he say? What did he say?

Wonderful!  He liked the monkey, didn't you?

Isn't he marvelous? He cost me a bundle, that horse, but he's worth it. I tell you, if you'd played Don Giovanni here it would have been a great success. I'm not joking. These people aren't fools. You could do something marvelous for them.

'Course you would. You belong here, my boy, not the snobby Court. You could do anything you felt like here - the more fantastic the better! That's what people want, you know: fantasy. You do a big production, fill it with beautiful magic tricks and you'll be absolutely free to do anything you want. Of course, you'd have to put a fire in it, because I've got the best fire machine in the city and a big flood - I can do you the finest water effects you ever saw in your life. Oh, and a few trick animals. You'd have to use those.

I'm serious. You write a proper part for me with a couple of catchy songs, I'll guarantee you'll have a triumph- de-luxe. Mind you, it'll have to be in German.

Of course! What else do you think they speak here?

Leave that alone!

Put it down!

Put it down, I said! It's nothing for you.

What?

Yes.

No.

Look, I asked you if we could start rehearsal next week and you said yes.

You won't be teaching this one either. She's my wife.

Never mind, Strudel. It's part of music, getting used to an audience. Aren't I right, Herr Mozart?

It's a miracle, Herr Mozart!

Herr Mozart. What a surprise. What can I do for you?

Well, your pupil is married and living in Mannheim, young man.

What is this, Mozart? What's the matter with you?

What for?

I know your work well, Signore. Do you know I actually composed some variations on a melody of yours?

Mio caro Adone.

Love, Sire!

Yes! yes! er, on  the whole, yes, Majesty.

How could I not?

I'm flattered. And congratulations to you, of course.

Why didn't you come to me yesterday, Mozart? This is a most painful situation. Yesterday I could have helped you. Today, I can't.

I have just come from the palace. The post has been filled.

My dear Mozart, there is no one in the world I would rather help, but now it is too late.

Herr Sommer.

No, no, no: he has yet to achieve mediocrity.

No, but I'm broke. I'm always broke. I don't know why.

How can anyone say that? We have no cook, no maid. We have no footman. Nothing at all!

They're stupendously successful. You can't get a seat. The only problem is none will hire me. They all want to hear me play, but they won't let me teach their daughters. As if I was some kind of fiend. I'm not a fiend!

Do you have a daughter?

Well, could you lend me some money till you have one? Then I'll teach her for free. That's a promise. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm being silly. Papa's right - I should put a padlock on my mouth. Seriously, is there any chance you could manage a loan? Only for six months, eight at most. After that I'll be the richest man in Vienna. I'll pay you back double. Anything. Name your terms. I'm not joking. I'm working on something that's going to explode like a bomb all over Europe!

Actually, it's a big secret. Oh, this is delicious! What is it?

Ah. Italian?

Two thousand, two hundred florins is all I need A hundred? Fifty?

I can't say. Really

Really? Why?

Why bother with Orsini-Rosenberg? He's obviously no friend of yours.

How fortunate.

Nine performances! Nine! That's all it's had - and withdrawn.

But what is it they don't like?

What did you think of it yourself? Did you like it at all?

I know, I know. Perhaps you should give me some lessons in that.

Oh no, the honour would be all mine.

Mozart. It was good of you to come.

Did my work please you?

Yes?

You flatter me.

I have come to commission work from you.

A Mass for the dead.

How long will you give me?

I don't have it yet. It's not finished. I'm sorry, but I need more time.

Where is your wife?

No, please.

I would never miss anything that you had written. You must know that.

I do.

What?

Shall I answer it?

Who?

Wait! Ask him if he'd give me some money now. Tell him if he would, that would help me finish it.

Another? But that's too soon! Tomorrow night? It's impossible! Did he say a hundred?

Would you? Actually, you could.

But you'd have to swear not to tell a soul. I'm not allowed.

You know, it's all here in my head. It's just ready to be set down. But when I'm dizzy like this my eyes won't focus. I can't write.

Where did I stop?

So now the Confutatis. Confutatis Maledictis. When the wicked are confounded. Flammis acribus addictis. How would you translate that?

Do you believe in it?

A fire which never dies. Burning one forever?

Strange!

Yes.

Start with the voices. Basses first. Second beat of the first measure - A.  Con-fu-ta-tis.  Second measure, second beat.  Ma-le-dic-tis.  G-sharp, of course.

Third measure, second beat starting on E.  Flam-mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis.  And fourth measure, fourth beat - D.  Ma-le-dic-tis, flam-mis a-cri-bus ad- dic-tis.  Do you have that?

Good. Now the tenors. Fourth beat of the first measure - C.  Con-fu-ta-tis.  Second measure, fourth beat on D.  Ma-le-dic-tis.  All right?

It couldn't be simpler.

With the tenors.

And that's all?

That's wonderful!

C Major. Sopranos and altos in thirds. Altos on C. Sopranos above.  Vo-ca, vo-ca me, vo-ca me cum be-ne- dic-tis.

And that's it. Do you have it?

Do you have it?

Do you want to rest a bit?

We'll stop for just a moment. Then we'll do the Lacrimosa.

I am so ashamed.

You mean in Turkey?

Then why especially does it have to be in German?

What you think, Mozart, is scarcely the point. It is what His Majesty thinks that counts.

That will do, Herr Mozart!

Mozart! Herr Mozart, may I have a word with you please. Right away.

Did you not know that His Majesty has expressly forbidden ballet in his operas?

Exactly. A dance.

Can we see the scene with the music back, please?

Then why doesn't he simply appoint me to the post?

No, but I'm the best.

Who is on this committee?

They hate my music. It terrifies them. The only sound Italians understand is banality. Tonic and dominant, tonic and dominant, from here to Resurrection!  Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Anything else is morbid.

Show them one interesting modulation and they faint. Ohime! Morbidezza! Morbidezza! Italians are musical idiots and you want them to judge my music!

Herr Mozart -

I don't think it was really decided, Director.

My dear fellow, the language is not finally the point. Do you really think that subject is quite appropriate for a national theatre?

Well done, Mozart. Really quite fine.

Mozart -

Mozart, music is not the issue here. No one doubts your talent. It is your judgment of literature that's in question. Even with the politics taken out, this thing would still remain a vulgar farce. Why waste your spirit on such rubbish?  Surely you can choose more elevated themes?

What do you want?

So?

Leave me alone.

Are they?

I do not seek forgiveness.

I can't say I do. What is it?

Well?

All Vienna has heard that.

Is it true?

No? Was Mozart a good man?

Oh? I thought you did so every day. So speak now. Answer me!

What?

Yes.

Why? Why? Why? Why add to your misery by confessing to murder? You didn't kill him.

No, you didn't!

My son, why should you want all Vienna to believe you a murderer? Is that your penance? Is it?

Oh my son, my poor son!

I've just learned something that might be of interest to you, Herr Director.

Mozart is writing a new opera. An Italian opera.

He's setting that play to music?

Are you absolutely sure?

Well, Mozart is already rehearsing.

What anger?

Bravo, Your Majesty!

Well, actually, Sire, if you remember, we did finally incline to Italian.

I know we banned this play, but frankly I can't remember why. Can you refresh my memory, Herr Director?

Oh yes, yes. And that was?

Here I am, my angel.

Now you've got to promise me faithfully you'll remain true to me forever. Then you'll see how tenderly your little birdie will love you.

Well, promise then.

Well, I don't know! I mean you're a delicious, delightful, delectable little bird, but don't you think you might be just a little tough?

This is embarrassing, you know. You introduced Mozart to some of my friends and he's begging from practically all of them. It has to stop.

Can't you think of anyone who might commission some work from him? I've done my best. I got him to arrange some Bach for my Sunday concerts. He got a fee - what I could afford. Can't you think of anyone who might do something for him?

How sad. It's tragic, isn't it? Such a talent.

She didn't say. But she says it's urgent.

That lady is back, sir.

What does he want?

Herr Salieri.

Can we come in?

But he's all right?

And say everything went wonderfully. A triumph-de-luxe - say that! Tell him the audience shouted his name a hundred times.

I'll call tomorrow.

Oh, by the way, give him this. This is his share. That should cheer him up, eh?

Has the patient in twenty-one gotten his tray yet?

You know, did he seem depressed? Do you think he'll eat the food?

Go about your duties.

What exactly did he call out?

That would be Jack Goodman, the boy who was killed.

The police report said an escaped lunatic attacked them. He must have been a very powerful man. Although I really don't see that it is any of your concern, Miss Price.

It's all right, Susan. Yes, Doctor, I have.

Oh dear girl, your extracurricular activities are of no consequence to me. I don't give a damn who you sleep with. I'm concerned about David.

It's a full moon. Where is he?

Well, yes, but he seems to be more upset by the death of his friend.

Yes.

David says Jack comes to warn him.

Dr. Hirsch, what's wrong? Is this more serious than I know?

And what else?

You've absolutely no idea where David might be?

Dr. Hirsch?

What shall we do?

He's here.

He doesn't remember. He woke up at the zoo.

Could you get here without any trouble?

Right. Now listen carefully. I want you to bring David here. I want him in my care. I'll notify the police that we've found him. It is imperative that you bring him straight to the hospital. Do you understand?

You're certain he's lucid? You won't need any help?

Shall I send a car?

What shall we do?

Nurse Hobbs said there's a disturbance in Leicester Square involving some sort of mad dog.

It wasn't a lunatic.

It was a wolf.

Mr. Kessler?

You haven't eaten your lunch.

I'm afraid you have to eat something.

Well, you're to take these after you've eaten. Now what kind of nurse would I be if I failed in so simple a task as giving out some pills?

Aw come on, Alex!

Call me David.

This is absurd. I'm not hungry. I don't want any food.

You're a very beautiful girl.

I was. What are you reading?

Do you like it?

What do you dream about?

How old are you?

How old are you?

I'm twenty-seven.

Now what do you want to talk about?

My best friend. My very best friend.

What? Oh, yes, please.

Yes, go on.

Hello. You all right?

Don't be silly. Can I get you something?

That's easy enough.

Now, David, I said I would keep you company, but I meant right here and now.

How did we get from your bad dreams to my taking a holiday with a patient?

You're being awfully forward, aren't you?

I'm a werewolf.

Are you better now?

My friend Jack was just here.

Yeah. He says that I will become a monster in two days. What do you think?

I was dreaming again?

The kitchen.

Bathroom.

The bedroom.

It's nice to see you.

Alex?

David, you don't honestly believe that in reality your friend Jack rose from the grave to breakfast with you? Do you really?

Tomorrow is the full moon.

Anything.

It's silly of you to be apprehensive.

David, do you want me to stay here tonight?

I've left those pills for you.

I'm off. There's food in the fridge.

Alex, I've lost my mind. I woke up at the zoo! But you know what? I feel terrific!

Waking up at the zoo, that's not so insane. Having no clothes on? That's insane. What did I do last night, Alex?

The next corner we can get a cab.

Dr. Hirsch will know what to do.

But...

David, what are you doing?

I am going to the cops. There's a full moon tonight. Jack was right. I...

David, please be rational. Let's go to Dr. Hirsch.

We had an argument. He's being silly.

Sir, he's very upset. His friend was killed and...

Hopeless. It's hopeless.

Hello, Benjamin.

Well, all right then, be that way. Here, swallow this.

Feeling better?

How are we feeling tonight?

No what?

Benjamin, have you ever been severely beaten about the face and neck?

He all right?

He's an American, you know. Dr. Hirsch is going to fetch round one of those Embassy fellows to see him.

I think he's a Jew.

I looked.

Take these round now, will you please? The American boy in twenty-one is only to have these after he's eaten. Will you be sure of that?

Nothing quite as dramatic as that, Miss Price. He just doesn't eat enough of what is put before him. He suffers from nightmares. I'd think he just needs a hand to hold.

Officer, I killed those people last night.

All right, you two, move along.

There's no call for that kind of language.

Now see here young man.

Mr. Bringsly, I'm sorry. I have absolutely no idea what to say to you.

Here, Gladys, Tom. Did you hear the one about the crashing plane?

You be quiet, woman, and let me speak.

All right, laugh then. I shan't tell it.

No one brought them here! No one wanted them here!

Mr. Kessler? Wake up, please.

Now go back to sleep so you'll be fresh for Dr. Hirsch in the morning.

It's nearly eight. I'm off duty shortly, then I'm off to the films with Alex.

Miss Price, the other nurse that attended you.

An American film about the Mafia called 'See You Next Wednesday', and I want to see it badly, so you give me no problems and go to sleep.

Some, everyone does.

Hello, David. I am Dr. Hirsch and this is a countryman of yours, Mr. Collins.

You're in a hospital in London.

I should think so after your recent traumatic experiences.

Miss Price! Miss Price, please!

Two weeks?

There were witnesses?

You've never had bad dreams before?

Did you get a good look at the man who attacked you?

Yes.

I really don't know.

David, please. The police are satisfied. I'm certain that if a monster were out roaming northern England we'd have seen it on the telly.

Are you cold?

Jack.

You're not having a good time are you?

Well, I like it here.

Do you think she'll meet me in Rome?

Debbie is not mediocre and she has one of the great bodies of all time.

You're talking about the woman I love.

Well, anyway, do you think she'll be there?

Rendezvous in Rome starring Jack Goodman and Debbie Klein. The love affair that shocked Europe! See torrid lovemaking at its most explicit! See Jack and Debbie expose their lust in the sacred halls of the Vatican! Never has the screen dared...

I have to make love to her. It's very simple. She has no choice really.

It is impossible for a body like that to be dull.

The Slaughtered Lamb?

That's a wolf's head.

That's not a spear. It's a pike.

Okay.

Hello.

Nice looking group.

Ask them what the candles are for.

Right.

Go on, ask them.

Jack, we'd better go.

Come on, Jack, shall we go?!!

What the hell was that all about?

That was weird. I guess leaving was the best idea.

What do you think was wrong?

Maybe that pentangle was for something supernatural.

Say, David...

Did you hear that?

A coyote.

The Hound of the Baskervilles.

Heathcliffe.

No, but he was on the moors.

I vote we go back to The Slaughtered Lamb.

Come on, where?

It's moving.

What's the plan?

It's in front of us.

Oh shit. What is that?

Nice doggie. Good boy.

See anything?

Jack?

Where are we going?

You really scared me, you shithead.

Nice to see you.

Thanks a lot.

David! You're hurting my feelings.

I'm sorry to be upsetting you, David, but I had to come.

Yeah. Your parents came to my funeral. I was surprised at how many people came.

Debbie Klein cried a lot.

I'm going completely crazy.

What?!

Warn me? Will you get out of here, you meat loaf?

If you love me so much, Jack, you'll realize how disconcerting it is to share one's breakfast with the living dead!

I'm not listening!

Shut up, you zombie!

It's you, David.

You survived and now you shall continue the curse.

Remember what that guy at The Slaughtered Lamb said? 'Beware the moon.'

You'll stalk the streets of London a creature of the night.

Listen to me! Take your own life, David. It's our only chance.

The supernatural! The powers of darkness! It's all true. Take your own life! Suicide, David. Join me.

You're not real.

What are you doing here?

I understand all right. You're one of the undead and I'm a werewolf.

Get out of here, Jack!

Jack, are you really dead?

What, Jack? That tomorrow night beneath the full moon I'll sprout hair and fangs and eat people? Bullshit!

Hi, Jack.

Aren't you going to say, 'I told you so'?

You look awful.

David Kessler, this is Gerald Bringsly.

Because this must be stopped.

I could hang myself.

No, thank you, Doctor.

You were saying?

The forensic lads seem to feel that some sort of animal was involved, that's true, but I hardly think...

What can we do to assist you?

Excuse me.  Yes?

What here?

Hello, there. What can I get you?

What's that?

Do you have any hot soup?

Hot chocolate?

Then you have some hot tea?

Oh.

Remember the Alamo?

Sorry.

Lieutenant, the boy seems pretty lucid to me and...

I don't rightly know, sir.

I cannot accept a connection between David Kessler and last night's murders. We will find him, however. I can assure you of that.

Hello, Tom.

Tom, I never had trouble getting credit from you before. When I was flat broke you gave me all the money I wanted. Now I come to you with a swell deal, and the greatest

What's the idea of turning her down? It sounds like a perfectly safe investment.

If she can't pay, I'll have to foreclose, won't I?

Oscar, what's the matter?

No kidding?

He has?

Say Matt, I'll have to have some money for those Manville payrolls.

About twenty-four thousand.

Yeah.

Say, do me a favor, will you Charlie?

Let me have ten bucks?

Charlie!

I'll pay it back to you Saturday - on the level I will. Give a guy a break, will you? I've got to get it back in my account. If Helen ever finds out that I

Whose death?

Say pal, did you ever hear of a Depression?

What's the matter, Charlie?

I remember once when your account checked.

And listen, wise guy - I'm setting friend time clock for exactly nine o'clock, so no squawks out of you guys in the morning.

Mr. Dickson in yet?

When he comes in, tell him we're waiting for him in the board room.

And tell him not to delay.

Don't make me laugh, Schultz!

What good will that do?

How are you protecting your depositors? By making a lot of idiotic loans!

You know Dickson as well as we do. He'll shut the doors before he gives up control.

Character, hmmpf! That's your idea?

Most of the creditors I know personally. I've seen them grow up in the community. I knew their fathers and mothers before them.

I'm running this bank my way. Get that clear!

We want to talk to you.

I know that among you, you have at least a million dollars in various banks throughout the city. Get that money over here and I'll stop this run within five minutes.

The depositors you were protecting were the first ones to pounce on you. You thought they were your friends. Why don't you go out there now and try and get some help from them?

Say, you can't do that

Dickson, I'd like to talk to you about the bank.

Come out here you pawnbrokers - take a look at this!

I hope you don't mind me asking you a few questions, Mr. Cluett.

Where were you at twelve o'clock last night?

That is simple, isn't it? I assume you can prove that if necessary.

Looks like you're going to have no trouble at all. What was the lady's name, Mr. Cluett?

Oh!

Thanks.

Stand back Inspector, or I'll shoot. Drop that gun.

Don't be a fool, Cluett. This is only going to make it worse for you.

What were you doing at Finlay's this morning?

I didn't kill him! I had nothing to do with that, I tell you! I was home in my apartment last night - I can prove it!

Confessed! Cluett, in heaven's name, what got into you?

Fifty thousand dollars!

What was my wife doing in your apartment last night?

You just mentioned her name. What was she doing there? What was she doing in your apartment?

She wasn't to blame, Mr. Dickson. It wasn't her fault. Honest, it wasn't. I begged her to come up. She didn't

That's your funeral. We've got fifty thousand dollars comin' to us.

Then what did you want to gamble for? If you'd have beat us out of fifty G's, you'd have been paid, wouldn't you? Well, we want our dough.

Good heavens, man! You're not suggesting that I

Why, I couldn't do that . . . !

What do you mean?

Dude - there's not any chance of my becoming involved in this, is there?

know, but

But Dude, listen - couldn't we make this some other time?

This won't do. Not during business hours . . .

Me?

Here, here, here, now! Don't you go back to work on me, too. I'm getting tired of this. Besides, it's beginning to affect your looks

running around. Not your work.  You'd better start reforming, Cyril!

Come on Cyril, try a little bit of it out on me. I haven't had any first-class blarney thrown at me since the day I was married.

Doesn't that come next?

Oh! Oh, no!  I think I've done enough experimenting for one day. Congratulations, Cyril. You've convinced me that you're a philanderer of the very first order. I shall recommend you highly.

You? No can do. It's all set. Just a few of Tom's closest friends.

Don't be silly, Cyril. These are respectable people. They'd probably bore you to death.

Why are you so anxious?

No.

What?

Now wait a minute, wait a minute...

Why, Cyril, you're insane

What's this?

I knew I couldn't trust you. You told me you were taking me home.

No. I know the answer to that one.  I think you'd better take me home.

No. No, I'm afraid papa isn't that much interested. He's too busy rushing off to Philadelphia to make stuffy, old speeches at stuffy, old bankers' meetings. Too busy closing big, important deals  I think I will have a drink.

And now fair woman, I have you in my power.

Why, Matt!

Are the payrolls ready for tomorrow?

Let me see your cash book, will you?

The butler said I could stay. I told him it was important.

Anything you have to say to me, you can say in the morning.

I'm not interested in what you think.

That will be just about enough! Now get out of here!

Good morning, Mr. Dickson.

Much better this morning, thank you.

Excuse me

I'm feeling fine this morning.

Shall we let the people come in?

Good morning, Mr. Dickson. My wife is much better this morning.

Well, look who's here! Hello, dear.

If this isn't a red-letter day for Tom Dickson! First I trample on the Board of Directors, then I promote Matt here to assistant cashier, and now to complete the day I have a visit from my sweet and lovely and gorgeous wife. What a man, what a man!

What's the matter dear? What have I done now?

Oh, I did have a date with you tonight, didn't I?

Now Tom, you simply cannot go to Philadelphia tonight. That's all there is to it.

I don't care whether it's important or not. You said you were going out with me, and if you hadn't promised so faithfully, I wouldn't have gone and planned the whole thing.

Ho! Ho! Ho!

Listen, don't go around being attractive to anyone but me . . .

Don't you forget that I'm still the head man around here too. Now we'll get the tickets changed for tomorrow night. You and I are going out together. How's that?

Listen, dear. I want to ask you something. I know it's a silly thing for me to ask you, but . . . I want you to tell me the truth. Where were you last night?

I don't know.

Why - well, I

Why, the directors are waiting for you in the board room.

Longer.

Helen, tell Matt I want to see him.

Oh, Mr. Dickson - they're going to arrest Matt. They think he did it!

In Mr. Sampson's office.

Come on in here, Helen. Bring your book. I want some numbers to try to get some action. Get Parker at the Union-Leeds - the Exchange . . . Winslow and old man Harris at the Home Mortgage. Snap into it, Helen. Just as quick as you can.

You want the rest of those numbers, Mr. Dickson?

Good morning, Helen.

Oh!

Yes?

Yes?

Helen!

Good morning, Mrs. Pembroke.

Got my letter?

Mr. Dickson?

Wait a minute. Where's your uniform?

You haven't got a uniform?

My goodness, you ought to have a uniform. How much does one cost?

Well, well, well - got your uniform, eh?

It's all right. Thanks.

What's the matter? You don't seem very excited about it.

Aw, I'm sorry, Mr. Dickson. It's just kind of sudden, that's all.  Sure, I'm excited. I think it's great. Only, well, you've done so much for me already . . . I'll never be able to thank you enough.

Well, I

I already told him I was home.

No. I won't.

No, I'm not Mr. Dickson!

We haven't got much time left, Mr. Dickson. We've got to do something quick or it'll be too late.

You're not giving up, are you, Mr. Dickson?

Well . . . uh . . . I . . .

I want you both to take the day off. Go downtown and get a license and get married right away!

What's the matter? What's going on here?  This is ridiculous! You can't hold this boy on a vague suspicion.

Why pick on him ?

What time did this thing happen?

That's what he says. I got a man from headquarters checking up on it now.

Maybe. But I'm taking no chances.  Why, this kid's got a record.

My wife? What's she got to do with you?

You're lying!

Well, Sampson, what is it?

Good. I'll take this along with me. Tell Clyde I'll see him tomorrow. I'm sick and tired of the delay.

The lobby's half filled now.

The bank's reputation wouldn't be worth a nickel after that. This is just a flurry, that's all. They've heard about the robbery and got panic-stricken. Listen, get a hold of our available securities and have them turned into cash. Wait a minute. Get my personal stuff and have that turned into cash too. Tell the boys anyone caught arguing with a depositor will be fired on the spot.

Look at them, Mr. Dickson. They're going crazy.

We can't keep open till four o'clock. We haven't cash enough to last an hour.

Mr. Dickson! Mr. Dickson!

Yes, sir.

Quiet down, please! Take it easy, folks. Everything will be all right.

How-do-you-do, Mrs. Dickson.

He's at a board meeting.

I'm afraid so.

No.

Oh, well. I guess the only other thing for me to do is to go out and buy myself a few sticks of dynamite. When he comes out, you tell him I'll be back. He hasn't gotten rid of me!

Hello, Helen!

Why?

Hey, look out, somebody's likely to see us!

What did you do with it?

Yes.

Yes.

Say, I just heard the merger isn't going thru. Isn't that grand?

What happened? What did he say? Did you get the job?

Oh Matt, you must be mistaken.

In Cluett's office?

What's keeping you?

Say Matt, you haven't done anything about what you saw today, have you?

Oh now, don't be silly.

Now you've got me worried, dear.  Promise me you won't butt in.

Shh . . . !  I'll wait for you upstairs.

Oh, Matt . . .

What's he doing, honey? Is he getting any help?

They must have turned him down.

Did you talk to him?

Dickson's in a jam I tell you. The run's getting worse.

The big guys have got the screws on him. You've got to come through for him, Mr. Conway. He came through for you a hundred times. If his friends don't help him, who is going to help him?

Did you say Dude Finlay?

What did you find out, Mike?

Never mind all that. What did you find out?

Dude Finlay?

Do you know this young man, Mrs. Halligan?

for the rheumatism, you know.

What time was it?

What time did Matt Brown get in?

Yes, I guess it was one, 'cause...

No. It wasn't earlier because...

No - because me clock struck four, and when it strikes four, it's one.

Listen here, young man - nobody ever called me a liar yet and got away with it

You turned off the burglar alarm, you set the time clock, came back at twelve and emptied the boxes, didn't you?

Sit down! When the watchman surprised you, you shot him - what'd you do with the gun?

Then who changed it?

So you were home last night?

What time did you get in?

Eleven o'clock, eh? Are you sure it was that?

But I wasn't here, Mr. Dickson. Honest I wasn't . . .

How are you fixed?

That mug reminds me of a guy with his second dollar.

Everybody in?

You can ride like that?

I think I may just go on to the reservation.

I couldn't lose him.

This is healing?

Gatling! They've got a Gatling!

He's smiling.

Never thought that pissant town would look so pretty.

Your Ma wouldn't let us leave until we ate something.

Here's Liberty's favorite son!  I'll never forget what you did, cousin.

Our place, Clell Miller's, Sammy Johnston, the Creeders. Will Hite.

These are deeds and mortgages of farms the bank was holding for the railroad.

No, Jimmy has a point. The Younger-James Gang could be confusing.

We got a problem here, brother?

That's what the newspapers say. Weren't for Jesse James, this gang wouldn't be able to find a goat's ass with a stick.

This is the best score yet.

Cole, we're outlaws. Not exactly the most respectable job, if you know what I mean.

How'd they --

I ain't done --

Bob. I didn't...

I swear --

Things changed when you quit the gang. For example, I'm now the one who says "Let's ride."

Yesterday.

Cole, I want to get to the farm, make sure Little Jim and the girls are okay.

They came up, made the same offer they made you folks. Our little brother Jim tried to chase 'em off, one of those detectives hit him in the head, knocked him out. Cole lost his temper.

The Army can hang him.

Home. We go home. We ride like hell to get there, and we kill anything or anyone that comes between us and our homes. And when we get there we stay there and God help any fool who tries to get me to leave my farm again.

How many of them did he kill?

You have no shame.

All right, settle down. All this money ain't ours.

"The outlaws calling themselves the James-Younger Gang shot their way out of town, wounding the Sherriff and three other townsfolk."

Okay, folks, I think we know how this is going to go...

Beg pardon?

This is about the "Wanted!" Posters, isn't it.

The things a fella has to do to get a little respect around here...

Listen, Jesse, we've got a problem.  It's Cole.

He's planning a job.

Listen, he's my brother and I don't want to start trouble...

What you sayin' boy?

How?

You shut up now, boy.

'Bout time you got here, buddy.

Ride with me, cousin?

Home, boys. Back to our farms.

Hands off your hip, Cole.

Not now.

You ever notice Zerelda's eyes?

She had a moustache.

Thanks for the help.

The war? What, are you crazy?  There are things I miss about it.

This isn't a feud, this is war. They've got more men than we do. We kill detectives, they can replace 'em in a day.

I'll pick the first job! I mean... I know a girl down at the bank. See if she can't get a list of towns where the railroad keeps its money.

I got seven thousand.

See, Frank's being smart about this.

It's not a bank.

"The Fidelity Bank and Trust was robbed on Tuesday by a gang of twenty heavily armed men."

Jesse, we got to have a word.

All the posters and newspapers are calling this bunch the "James-Younger Gang."

This is your fault for hogging all the publicity.

It'll be the biggest score yet.

Smells funny, it being mentioned in the paper.

What are you saying?

And almost got hanged in peacetime.

I'm the better soldier, Jesse.

Fine. We hit this bank.

Dammit!

Okay, you're gonna rest here.

Bob, rip up some bandages.

We'll make them pay for this.

WHAT?! We follow you for a year, and now that our blood's been spilled, you're gonna quit?!

Missed you, cousin.

You know, you gettin' caught, right after leaving us, some people thought --

Where'd you get all these riders?

Some Indian tracker you turned out to be, Tom.

Tom, why don't you stop at our spread before you head on out to the reservation? Figure we might have some work for you, if you want.

Well?

Cannon or Gatling?

What the --

I think one of 'em's glass.

Oh, Lord, the dance hall girl at Bunty's...

I have no idea what you just said, but it sounded real nice.

BASTARDS! Come back here and face me!

Hey! We decide something, that's it! We're in this for the long haul, and this idea of me and Jesse's will help give us more places to hide out without worrying about some farmer with a shotgun sneakin' up on us in our sleep. We've got to think --

Jesse.

Another dozen out back.

The safe. Now.

What?

Great Chief of St. Louis send me.

Of St. Louis?

East? East above the river heading for the Eagle Pass?

I know it ain't no durned bank holiday!

Then why can't I go in there?

Oh. Why didn't you just say so?

Fine. I'll just wait here.

What the --

Old Man Tucker is just standing quiet outside the bank.

Where the hell were you?

-- rode right into them, screaming like a banshee.

Boys...

What do you say, sir?

He's going to be fine, right Daddy?

They're gone. What are you --

He thinks this is some kind of game!

Every time I put my head up to hit that Gatling, they try to shoot it off.

Distracting enough for you?

So you're saying I could have done more to attract their attention.

Such as?

See, that's your problem, Frank. By the time you finish figuring out stuff, I'm already finished doing it.

Web's dead.

Looks like Web Mimms wasn't the only casualty this town's got.

Frank, don't you have something to say?

All we thought about was coming home. I swore I'd kill anybody who tried to get me off my farm again. If I have to go to war with the railroad to stay, fine by me.

"Big and older"?

She's still talking to Jesus.

You know him?

I went up to the courthouse and looked at the right of way documents for the rail bed. The railroad doesn't even need our land, they're just taking the land on both sides for as far as they can.

You ready to stop loafing around with this young lady and get back to farming?

You're looking a bit more spry now that somebody --

Pinkertons. It's the railroad.

... We could move on. Rebuild. Make a decent life someplace else.

Didn't think you would.  I'm going to go make the coffin.

How'd it go in there?

And I planned getting you off the hangman's deck --

And it's guarded by Pinkerton detectives.

I don't think it's counterfeit. Do you mind if I take a look at all your real bills to compare?

Gents, we are in the middle of something here.

Pardon the delay, folks, but we had to get Mad Bob Younger under control!

This has been a good year.

That's a lie. You could've bought a dozen farms with the money we've stolen.

We're doing this for Ma.

What do you want me to say, Frank? I was killing men when I was fifteen. I like getting shot at. I like riding out of town with a posse at my back. This is a helluva better life than farming.

We're drunk.

You taking sides against me, now, Frank?

Shoulda learned with Web. Made it look fun, made it look like an adventure. Got Web killed. Now Jim.

You're a piss-poor liar for the smartest man I know.

A war against the railroad. What the hell were we thinking?

I'll meet you down there in a few weeks.

Y'know, Uncle Frank...

...every time you tell that story, you stop there. That's not how it ended. I was five when my dad got shot.

Allow a man his version of the past. When you get to be my age, you've got enough painful memories, you're allowed to soften a few of the edges up.

That he was.

Can't argue that.

Uncle Frank?

How much of that story is true?

Did you kill Yankees?

The Lord says we can bury 'em out back in the orchard, nobody'll ever find them.

Ma! Please!

Riders --

Doc Mimms will --

Zerelda? Little Zee Mimms?

But still died.

Jesse, are you awake?

Jesse, is that your hand?

You shouldn't be up.

You're sick of my company?

Everybody in the county knows it was you who rescued Cole. We're all so proud of you, Jesse. And not a single farm's been sold to the railroad since. You're everybody's hero.

So you're saying I should leave you alone and go spend time with Jimmy Younger?

I used to come to this tree when I was a kid and imagine what my life would be like when I got older.

Arr. Hand over your jewels, Missy.

Mostly. It would be an all right life, for a bachelor.

Not if I find the right girl.

Smart. Funny. Bossy. Always makes me think she's two steps ahead of me. And big buck teeth.

Ahem. "From this doctrine..." No, ah... "From women's eyes this doctrine I derive, they sparkle still like ... shiny... sparkling rocks..."

Little ones.

I am so sorry, Jesse.

You and I, we've started... something, you know?  I don't know what'll happen if you do this.

Let the law --

Whose justice? Yours or God's?  When will you stop?

Zee.

I don't understand.

That's... wonderful. It's just... I thought...

I would never have imagined us in a place like this.

Let me see that.

Now, sweetie, y'all wouldn't go believing one of them silly dime novels, would you?

Aw, shucks, ma'am...

Don't turn around.

You get arrested again, I'll kill you.

I can't believe I had to blow up a train for you.

Don't swear.

We're moving you tomorrow.

Oh, it's a similar room. But the hotel is in Washington D.C. You're not going to get a fair trial down here, in front of a jury of Jesse James sympathizers.

Did you order our houses burned down?

You almost ended my career before it began.

How did you spot the ambush in Torrell?

Mmm.

Almost got me in Billings. I saw you there, shooting at me.

That's what I would have done.

You cocky little bastard.

That was for my Ma. Now this is for everybody else.

The railroad has no business in Tennessee. Therefore I have no interest in the state of Tennessee.

I'd just as soon kill you, Jesse James. But chasing you takes up too much of my time.

The Lord is remarkably tolerant of the charitable.  "Jesse Woodson James." Jesse James? The Jesse James?

Discretion? Sir, I am a man of the cloth.

Now let's have a drink.

And you're too young.

I like that.

Well, not exactly.

Hell yeah! I been with...  Uh, not exactly. It's just, I don't want to get one of these paid ladies, you know?

You and Frank and Cole, and even Bob, get all these girls because you're good looking and famous. You don't have to pay. They just look at me like I'm the baby brother.  Don't tell anyone, okay Jesse?

What about that Rock Island bastard?

... too young for whisky...

Jesse, you explain to Lyla. My girl, you know, from that time...

Why, yeah.

Really?

Not at all.

Thank you, Miss -- ?

Why don't we get a bottle of sherry to sip while we talk?

Devereux. My brother Cole dated a European girl once.

Well, this land is about to be condemned.

Relax, Alan. The Army has this all in hand. And Mr. Thaddeus Rains will be very pleased with this news. Nothing like a hanging to motivate the populace to relocate.

My professional opinion is that you have managed to piss off the wrong bunch of farm boys this time.

How can that be?

There's only four of them...

Mr. Thaddeus Rains, sir, it is a pleasure to have you join us in the field.

Parker, tell me what's going on so I can return as quickly as possible to Boston and my whores and cigars, not necessarily in that order.

Good.

Leaving you in charge of operations until he recovers.

Just perfect.

You see the Army leaving and you see the loss of a tool. I see a power void to be filled. As we have the most power, we may move with impunity.

They exchanged fire with the Pinkerton Guards, killing several of them. Then they raided the payroll office and blew the tracks for half a mile.

Thirty-five thousand, sir. Coins and currency. And the delay from the miles of destroyed track --

Your men knew the risks.

With my money!

Parker.

This is him.

This is no game.

"A Rock Island and Pacific Railroad depot was robbed two nights ago just outside St. Louis, Missouri. The brave and daring James-Younger Gang was heavily outnumbered by Pinkerton detectives, but the city lawmen were no match for the guns of the West."

"The gang made off with thirty-five thousand dollars and also destroyed the Thaxton Switch construction, meaning that for a few months honest farmers will be able to sleep without fearing the railroad is coming to steal their land!"  Who wrote this!? I'll see him hanged every Tuesday for a month!

It's early in the game yet, Mr. Rains. Jesse James and I are just learning how each other moves, feeling out each other's patterns.

Hardly farmers. I've done some checking. All these were in the War. These men know sabotage, tactics, and have four years of bloody fighting experience behind them. They are disciplined, well-trained and have a charismatic leader. If I were to design the perfect outlaw band, this gang is what I would create.

First of all: you, shut up.  Now, you've given me a thousand miles of railroad to cover. Every time the James Gang strikes, we shift a hundred detectives to that area. But there's just too much open land, too many riverbeds to ride, caves to hide in. This gang operates across four states, often riding a hundred miles between jobs.

Yes, that's the way to win the locals back to our side.

No, you demand results. They are not the same thing. And if you want results, you will let me do my job as I see fit. Unless of course,  You want this fool to saddle up and take another run at it?

So he's won.

There are only four banks within that travel radius which they have not robbed.

No need. I have another tool at my disposal which will narrow it down to one bank.

What the hell is that sound?

Listen, what are you doing tonight?

Listen, you're dating Luis, he's in Arizona. You're fucking me, and we haven't made plans. What could you possibly be up to tonight?

Ummm . . yeah. Luis is calling me tonight. I need to be home for that.

Yes?

I know. Stop it.

Patrick don't call me pumpkin anymore, okay? I have to go.

Dorsia's nice.

You like it there, don't you?

Okay. Yeah. What time?

A facial at Elizabeth Arden, which was really relaxing, then to the Pottery Bam where I bought this silver muffin dish. 

Oh God, Patrick. Shut up.

J&B. Straight.

This is Dorsia?

Courtney, you're going to have the peanut butter soup with smoked duck and mashed squash. New York magazine called it a 'playful but mysterious little dish." You'll love it. And then...the red snapper with violets and pine nuts. I think that'll follow nicely.

Luis is a despicable twit.

It's a plain end. I think.

It's a plain end, see? So?

Why?

Oh Christ, this really isn't worth it. And see, Courtney, it's there for what? Huh? Tell us.  Why is it pulled down half an inch? So it can catch the force of the ejaculate!

Will you call me before Thanksgiving?

What are you doing tonight?

That's nice.

Listen...Patrick. Can we talk?

Patrick?

I haven't seen you around here.

Do you want to come to my apartment or not?

You have a really nice place here...Paul. How much did you pay for it?

I'm not so sure about this. I had to go to Emergency after last time...

Nothing like last time, promise.

So, you're looking great, how have you been?

Really?

Marzipan. Pink tents. Hundreds, thousands of roses. Photographers. Annie Leibovitz. We'll get Annie Leibovitz. And we'll hire someone to videotape. Patrick, we should do it.

Get married. Have a wedding.

Yes, darling?

We should do it.

Well, you hate that job anyway. Why don't you just quit? You don't have to work.

Pat, this is my cousin Vanden and her boyfriend Stash. He's an artist.

Why don t you just go for Price?

He's rich.

He has a great body

I want a firm commitment.

Why? What's wrong?

We need to talk.

It's over, Evelyn. It's all over

I'm fucking serious. It's fucking over. Us. This is no joke. I don't think we should see each other anymore.

You're really serious, aren't you?

But what about the past? Our past?

No, no, no.

If you really want to do something for me, you can stop making this scene right now.

Where are you going?

But where?

You'll notice that my friends and I all look and behave in a remarkably similar fashion, but there are subtle differences between us. McDermott is the biggest asshole. Van Patten is the yes man. Price is the most wired. I'm the best looking. We all have light tans. Right now I'm in a bad mood because this is not a good table, and Van Patten keeps asking dumb, obvious questions about how to dress .

Picked them up from the printers yesterday

Eggshell with Romalian type.  What do you think?

But Laurie Kennedy is a total hardbody. What do you think, Bateman?

Because he dated her.

Girls dig Bateman. He's CQ. You're total CQ, Bateman.

Do you know what Ed Gein said about women?

Listen, what about dinner?

Can I help you?

Doesn't he live here?

No. Yes. I mean yes, I did. In the Times. But... doesn't Paul Owen still live here?

Excuse me, gentlemen. Right back. He approaches Carnes cautiously.

By the way Davis, how is Cynthia? You're still seeing her, right?

What are you talking about? Bateman is what?

Excuse me. I really must he going.

Now, Carnes, listen to me. Listen very, very carefully. I killed Paul Owen and I liked it. I can't make myself any clearer

It never was supposed to he! Why isn't it possible?

Because I had dinner with Paul Owen twice in London...just ten days ago.

Patrick, thanks so much for looking after Courtney. Dorsia, how impressive! How on earth did you get a reservation there?

That's a wonderful jacket. Let me guess, Valentino Couture?

It looks so soft.

Patrick? Is that you?

This is Gwendolyn Ichiban. This is my very good friend Patrick Bateman. Where are you going? We're going to Nell's. Gwendolyn's father's buying it.  Where did you get your overnight bag?

Call me please, Patrick.

What...is...it?

I've gotta...I've gotta...return some videotapes.

Van Patten looks puffy. Has he stopped working out?

That's Paul Owen.

Jeez. That's not a helluva lot, is it?

Is he fucking selling it by the milligram?  Oh my God...

Oh come on. Price. There are a lot more important problems than Sri Lanka to worry about. Sure our foreign policy is important, but there are more pressing problems at hand.

What's that, a gram?

Don't, I'll drink it.

Where to? Are you going to go get a gram?

Don't tell me...merchant banking?

And Bateman, what are YOU SO fucking zany about?

Dorsia.

Marcus Halberstam. For two at eight?

I said we are totally booked.

There are no tables available tonight. The waiting list is also totally booked.

Late?

Ricky Hendricks has to cancel today. He didn't say what he was canceling or why.

And...Spencer wants to meet you for a drink at Fluties Pier 17.

After six.

Oh? And what should I say?

Oh, something. . romantic?

I'll do it.

Ummm...what? I didn't hear you.

You don't like this, I take it?

Ye-es, Je-an?

Tell him I'm at lunch.

Patrick?

Jean?

That is...if you're not doing anything.

Anywhere you want?

Oh, I can't.  I don't know.

Soooo...Dorsia is where Jean wants to go...

Yes? You're dressed...okay.

Jean? Sorbet?

Want a bite?

Well, maybe we shouldn't go out to dinner. I don't want to ruin your willpower.

And don't tell me you enjoy working with children, okay?

Do you have a boyfriend?

Interesting.

Maybe. I don't know Not really. Bateman opens up a cupboard where there are a lot of very Bateman opens a cupboard where there are a lot of neatly ordered weapons - an ax, a rifle, a chain saw, duct tape, twine and a nail gun.

Well, I guess I do. For a long time I was too focused on my work, I think, but now I've really begun to think about changing myself, you know, developing, and...growing.

Did you know that Ted Bundy's first dog, a collie, was named Lassie? Had you heard this?

Forget it.

Oh. Uh, tape. Duct tape. I...need it for... taping something. Bateman goes back to the cupboard for the nail gun.

What...No! Put it in the carton.

Jean? What?

I'm looking for...I guess you could say I just want to have a meaningful relationship with someone special.

Yes. I don t think I can...control myself.

If you stay, I think something bad will happen. I think I might hurt you.  You don't want to get hurt, do you?

And don't forget you have a breakfast meeting with Frederick Bennet and Charles Rust at '21.

Patrick Bateman's office.

Patrick? Is that you?

Where are you?

Craig McDermott called. He wants to meet you and David Van Patten and Tim Price at Harry's for drinks.

Where are you? Patrick, what's wrong?

...to the office this afternoon.

Just...say...no!

So, what do you do?

A model? An actor?

Welt...it depends, why?

Oh really? DAISY He said...  He said you gave him bad vibes.

You think I'm dumb. You think all models are dumb.

Hi, Patrick. I thought that was you.

Well.

Well, I mean, um, it s really...Bosco. You know, like... like a Dove Bar. It's a Dove Bar...Hershey's Syrup?

Maybe we could have lunch one day next week? You know, I'm downtown near Wall Street quite often.

Yeah.

What do you mean, she was a hot number.

She's my...cousin.

This tastes weird.  Harley? It's me. I need your services. Translate that anyway you'd like. I'm at-

Who?

Did you know that guy who disappeared? Didn't he work at Pierce & Pierce, too? Was he a friend of yours?

Listen, I would just like to see...the two of you...get it on. What's wrong with that? It's totally disease-free.

Come on. Don't you find Christie attractive?

Are you telling me you've never gotten it on with a girl?

Did you know that Whitney Houston's debut LP called simply Whitney Houston had four number-one singles on it? Did you know that, Christie? Whitney's voice leaps across so many boundaries and is so versatile-though she's mainly a jazz singer-that it's hard to take in the album on a first listening.

Listen, John, I've got to go. T Boone Pickens just walked in...  Just joking...  No don't tip the owner of the salon. Okay, John, right, got it.  Sorry about that.

Hi. I'm Donald KIMBALL

So, what's the topic of discussion?

Ah, I see...Yes. Paul's disappearance...Yes.

Perrier? San Pellegrino?

KIMBALL.

Oh no, I'm okay.

Oh right. Well, I haven't heard anything about the disappearance or anything...  Not on "Page Six" at least.

Understandable.  Lime?

Just some preliminary questions that I need for my own files, okay?

How old are you?

Your address?

Nice. Very nice.

Pardon me, but are you okay?

Bad habit.

Would you rather I not smoke?

How well did you know him?

Yeah...Yale thing.

Where did Paul hang out?

He had a yacht?

Don't you know this?

So was I.

Well, there's a message on his answering machine saying he went to London.

His girlfriend doesn't think so.

Well, I've had a hard time getting an actual verification. A Stephen Hughes says he saw him at a restaurant there, but I checked it out and what happened is, he mistook a Hubert Ainsworth for Paul, so...

I know it sounds like a lame question, but in New Jersey I know this sounds like a lame question, but last month-I don't know if you've heard about this, but a young stockbroker was recently arrested and charged with murdering a young Chicano girl and performing voodoo rituals with various body parts-

Have you consulted a psychic?

Had his apartment been burglarized?

I mean no one's dealing with the homicide squad yet or anything, right?

That's so typical, isn't it?

Nothing.

The earth just opens up and swallows people. 

You'll have to excuse me. I have a lunch meeting with Cliff Huxtable at Four Seasons in twenty minutes.

Uh, no. There's one...down here.

Detective Kendall...uh Campbell? KIMBALL Kimball.  Call me Don.

So...you hang out here a lot?

How's the investigation going? Taken anyone in for "formal questioning?" 

Yeah. No Finlandia, as usual. Fucking dump.

I actually came to see Timothy Price, but he's taken a leave of absence.

Do you remember where you were on the night of Paul's disappearance?  Which was on the twentieth of December?

I had a date with a girl named Veronica.

Well...I...Wait...What information have you received?

Well, I could he wrong.

Well, thank you, Mr. Bateman.

Listen, I'm a little spent for now but how about lunch in a week or so when I've sorted out all this information?

And if you could try and pin down where you were the night of Owen's disappearance, it would make my job a lot easier.

Never. I mean...I don't really like... singers.

No, I like music. Just-they're-Huey's too... black sounding. For me.

No hash browns?

I think maybe you've got your dates mixed up.

According to his date book, and this was verified by his secretary, he had dinner with...Marcus Halberstam.

I've questioned him.

Yes. And he denies it. Though at first he couldn't be sure.

Yes.

He does? You're sure?

He wasn't with Paul Owen.

Oh, right. Of course...We had wanted Paul Owen to come. But he said he had plans...I guess I had dinner with Victoria...the following night.

I'm so hungry.

I'm so hungry.

I lost my job...

Gee, uh, that's too bad.

Why don't you get another one? Why don't , you get another job?

I know that, I know that. Jeez, you're like a broken record. I'm trying to help you.

Listen, do you think it's fair to take money from people who do have jobs? From people who do work?

Listen, what's your name?

Speak up. Come on.

Shhhh...it's okay.

Do ,you know how bad you smell? The stench, my God.

Really? That's interesting.  Not great?

And how's Cecilia? She's a great girl.

Listen, the mud soup and the charcoal arugula are outrageous here.

Hey, I'm a child of divorce. Give me a break  Hmmm, I see they've omitted the pork loin with lime jello.

So, wasn't Rothschild originally handling the Fisher account? How did you get it?

And Cecelia, how is she? Where is she tonight?

Evelyn. Great ass. Goes out with that loser Patrick Bateman. What a dork.

Paul, give me your Amex card. Good boy. Bateman slaps the card down, looks at the check.

No, man. I'm gonna bail.

You like Huey Lewis and the News?

Hey, Halberstam?

Why are there copies of the Style section all over the place? Do you have a dog? A chow or something?

Is that a raincoat?

You think so?

How can he lie like that? How can he pull that shit?

I just don't see how someone, anyone, can appear that way and yet be involved in such total shit. How can you be so fucking, I don't know, cool about it?

Is it over?

You are a fanatic.

Alice? You gotta make him do the start-up with Teddy and me.

I'm just screwed.

I think I kind of lost it. I was just so thrilled to be talking to the richest, most powerful... 'Didn't know I even cared about that stuff.

A lot of what Larry says is true. They just clone stuff, or reverse engineer it, and everybody gets stuck with their inferior version cause they --

When I was a kid? And he was moving us all over the place? I spent all my time writing stuff on Outpost 1.0. I thought Gary Boyd was the greatest.

...But?

I forgot. That's why you have to help me decide.

C'mon, I wouldn't have a destiny without you. My destiny would be dying at 20. From eating --

When's Brian coming for the TV?

You know he's never been anybody's counselor before?

To our new life.  ...What's wrong?

It's the way he said it. Just the way my dad did, when he was caught in a lie. That's how you knew you were onto something ugly.

He's your boss. He's not your --

If you can't deal with him on that basis, you better get a new counselor.

I mean, if one little comment from Gary is gonna upset you this much --

What!

What're you -- what?

Are you saying you think they had something to do with his death? Nelson said it was an airtight case.

I can't see Outpost putting its reputation in the hands of people like that.

Go where? You can't get away from people like this.

You think I don't know that?

How should I know? "Solving a problem," I guess. Or needing to control everything. I don't know.  I've gotta get in there.

It's the only one with dishes on the roof. The studio's a front. That's why they keep postponing its opening.  ...gotta get in there.

I can't just walk away!

I know how to get in there. But you've gotta help me.

It's almost nine, I've been so worried!  What did you see in there?

It's what they said it is. An unfinished broadcast studio. You were right... I just drove to Seattle and back.

After I broke into 21 -- which was insane, thank God they didn't catch me! -- I just drove around. Trying to figure out what possessed me. You know what? I've been putting my own guilt on Gary.

If I'd stayed down there, maybe this wouldn't've happened.

Look at this.

Why doesn't he ask us to his party. He's never even met you.

It's for the Museum. He knows you're a painter. If anybody should be invited --

I know you think I'm too attached to him, but still. I am close to Gary. And you're the most meaningful person in my life.  I'm going back to the Comix place, why should I be killing myself.

Are you gonna tell me where you went?

No. No. I sent an E-mail to somebody, just now. To tell her how I feel about you.  You know I'm clueless, without you. You know I --

You look beautiful.

Milo?

Here we go.

...wanna savor this.

Right. Wait. A toast.

'Didn't mention he was going to the Justice Department?

Not like him, is it? To do a thing like that without telling you. You're not losing your hold on him, are you?

Lisa's an extremely valuable member of the Skywire team. We've got our eyes on her. You keep yours on Milo.

Beggar. We're at a disadvantage with Outpost. Our experts aren't as smart as theirs. Sometimes we can't tell which technologies pose the threat of a monopoly. We need a really smart guy to help us pick our fights. I'm taking a shot in the dark, here. I can offer you 32,000 a year, a Buick. I'm hoping you've got a feeling it's the right thing to do.

Mr. Barton, do you remember me?

Milo?

What seems to be the problem? You look a little upset.

Milo?

My goodness.

If there's a Civil Rights violation. But generally we let the local police and DA do their work first.

Let me look into it, see what's being done. Frankly, it's not my area.

And Outpost? You're happy there?

You're living here?

Well I parked illegally. See y'later?

This is the biggest Beta demo in like the history of software. You'd be my partner.

What?

Okay.

What?!

...When did you know?

That's gotta kill him, right?

Conglomerates're lined up to finance the launch of the remaining satellites. They'll pay him a huge premium to get on-line.

Stigma? Larry! 60 billion buys you some slack in this world.

Milo. Surprised he's not your guest.

'Couldn't convince Teddy to come?

We could move 'em up here.

Who's that?

You know a lot about art, I guess.

I've only shown this to three other people. I bought 200, we've launched 12 so far. I keep the coordinates in this room.  It's left over from SDI. Reagan's Star Wars technology? They orbit 426 miles up.

The content filer has t'be written into the media files so bits coming off the satellite can be read by multiplatforms. Really, omniplatforms. Including whatever new hardware emerges.

'Think I should buy some originals?

Somebody said I'm just another Philistine. With reproductions.

It's okay. Really.

You did this -- overnight?

Milo. What's up?

You really wrote this just today?

Everything I do is under scrutiny. The questions they ask, trying to make anything strategic look sordid.  I'm confused. Doesn't everybody in business try to get ahead?

It scales, don't you think?

Had you talked to him much lately?

Did you?

I meant did you find other stuff to --

Been thinking about the push mechanism in the handler. And it came over me: it's in the wrong place.

Gary, hi.

Why did you move around so much? When you were a kid.

No. I just went deeper into the machine. Preferred being the geek to having to explain. Lying would've been worse.

That's great! Thanks.

"Dear Lisa. I've enjoyed working with you. I'd be lying if I didn't say I find you attractive. But in my heart I know that Alice..."  You left my party to send E-mail?

You could've handwritten it.

Gary, I --

I hope you know what you mean to me. Not just because of what you're doing. Because of who you are.

I'm pretty close. But when I wrote the last contact switches, it wiped out a piece of the content filer. You know what it's like, writing software.

This is good. Who did it?

Hasn't affected his work, though.

Help me change the Skywire settings. Add five degrees to each satellite coordinate.

Okay, #2.

Ready for number three?

Longitude 109 --

Gary?

I think you should go.

I know you lost all his work. Maybe I could come down here and --

Your app kind of blew mine out of the water.

...You wanna work -- here?

You guys'll be using Teddy's old space, is that okay?

Could it be a glitch? Something the construction workers caused?

Every entry was authorized.

What're we looking for?

Delbert seems to enter #21 twice. Without leaving the first time.

Get the backslash, the colon, keys kids don't use but geeks do.  What would Milo want in here, anyway?

You calling Phil and Randy?

Come with me.

Now what are we doing? I don't get any of this shit!

Lisa.

You know mine.

I'm getting a teacher's pet rep.

...Were you?

Me too! Were you an Army brat or something?

Did I say something?

What've you got there?

Cool!

Did you wanna be alone?

Maybe once. I re-wrote it, anyway.

Mmm-more like -- I have a little trouble. Trusting people.

So, when you were talking about wishing people were more like computers. Was that then? Or now?

That's great. I -- didn't know.

I snuck into #21.

You thought about it too. You've been suspicious for a while. But it's not happening in there. It's happening in the Day Care.

It's easy to know who the smart geeks are, the schools tell 'em. They upload medical files, school records, pharmacy files. They'd be happy just to steal code forever. But when a program gets close to fruition. Like Teddy. He was almost there.

Is that my -- scenario?  Tell me.

He's out of prison?

...Milo?

What about the FBI?

Who can we trust?

Do we post it on the Net?

The mainstream media. TV, or a newsmagazine.

We could cross-reference a data base on media ownership. But not on our own computers. Not even at home.

He's buying up pretty much everything: cable companies, baby bells, picture libraries, museum rights, film archives... Getting ready for Skywire.

Time?

How close are you?

We can't just assume they're standing by to receive Skywire 12 months from launch. I'd have to write in an aglet.

It's how on-line services push logos they wanna sell you. You don't ask for 'em, they just appear. 'Have to work on it somewhere besides my office or my house. And then the quality of the broadcast wouldn't exactly be digital, that's 12 months away.

Gary knows I'm close on Skywire. We have to do this fast.

Oh, man. I'd have to get into Gary's house. To get the satellite positions.

I don't know --

Why were you so careless?

Why were you snooping in my office?

'Think everybody in this place is here the same reason we are?

I felt guilty. 'Cause I "owed so much" to Alice. But even then I was starting to wonder. Is it so great to be so consumed by this one thing that you let another person do your thinking for you? If you have a lucrative skill, it's all anybody wants from you. You grow older but you don't grow up. You turn into -- into --

Great. I knocked off the aglet, as soon as I get a passable version of Skywire we're there.

They know I broke in. Alice helped me.  Shrot's not one of them. He's blundering into this on his own.

Hardly anybody does, that's the beauty part. No cameras, the DOJ doesn't bother with it, it's accessed by a tunnel they boast about. You know the best place to hide a leaf?

Oh.

Same with the excerpts I'm choosing: they'll play against any of the images you described.

You could always say you have to go the bathroom.

Does he know you know?

Why?!

Please don't go.

They know, I had no choice. Get out of the house now! Do you have a laptop?

Bring it to the other location.

Maybe it's the satellite.

...He knows.

Latitude 47 degrees.

...You got my E-mail?

Wanted to say goodbye to him...

We rented a loft in Sunnyvale.  You know what's the bad part? We can't talk about work anymore. We're competitors! The venture capitalists made us sign like 100 confidentiality forms.

But these, like, White Supremacists trashed my office, last week.

Did you tell Alice?

A beautiful geek? I don't wanna sound paranoid, or like a pig, but what're the chances?

I dunno. I guess Larry's got me totally suspicious of that place.

Milo, geeks don't have two girlfriends. Most don't have one.

So -- how far are we from the campus?

So how'd you like the house?

Every geek here's got a thing for Lisa. But that's about the biggest reaction she's had to anybody.

What're they building?

Gary's not into fiber optics. He's betting everything on the satellites.

We tried the big vaporware number, Gary, it's no-sale.

Maybe he'll get back to work.

Did you download Corey? In San Jose?

What is it?

There's nothing in this hall. Someone's pulling your chain, as usual.

That kid's the great white hope.

Who're these guys?

Fellas, I'm gonna have to ask you to leave here now.

You seem surprised to see me.

Call me Ritchie, Miss Fagina. May I call you Alotta...  Please?

Your boss, Number Two, I understand that cat's involved in big underground drills.

Come in.

In Japan, men come first and women come second.

Care for some saki?

'Pardon me for being rude, It was not me, it was my food.  It just popped up to say hello, and now it's gone back down below.'

'Milk, milk, lemonade.  Round the corner fudge is made.  Stick your finger in the hole, And out comes a tootsie roll!'

To my health.

Yes.

I'll tell you all in due time, after we make love. But first, tell me another poem.

Austin Powers? Hi, I'm Andy Warhol.

Hungry.

I'm going to paint this can of soup and become famous and not give you any credit for it.

Hello, Austin. This is Basil Exposition, Chief of British Intelligence.  You're Austin Powers, International Man of Mystery, and you're with Agent Mrs. Kensington. The year is 1967, and you're talking on a picture phone.

I just wanted to be extremely clear so that everyone knows what's going on at any given time. We've just received word that Dr. Evil, the ultimate square, is planning to take over the world.

Just where you'd never think to look for him. We'll be there.

Yes?

Where am I?

WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE?

Yes, I'm having trouble controlling...  THE VOLUME OF MY VOICE!

Russian Intelligence? Are you mad?

Thank God. Those capitalist dogs will finally pay for their crimes against the people, hey Comrades?

When do I begin?

You mean Mrs. Kensington?

Vanessa's one of our top agents.

Yes, well...Agent Kensington will get you set up. She's very dedicated. Perhaps, a little too dedicated.  She's got a bit of a bug up her ass. Good luck, Austin, the world's depending on you.

Oh, and Austin...

Be careful.

Hello Austin. Hello Vanessa. This is Basil Exposition, from British Intelligence.  There's a company in Las Vegas called Virtucon that we think may be linked to Dr. Evil. Many of the Virtucon executives gamble at the hotel/casino where you'll be staying. That's the first place you should look.  Well, I'm off to the chat rooms.

Hello, Austin, this is Basil Exposition from British Intelligence. Thank you for confirming the link between Dr. Evil and Virtucon. Find out what part Virtucon plays in something called Project Vulcan. I'll need you and Vanessa to get on that immediately.

She's working on another lead right now.

Thank you, Basil.

Thank you, Exposition. Only two things, scare me, and one is nuclear war.

Excuse me?

Carnies.

Circus folk.  Nomads, you know. They smell like cabbage.

Maybe these photographs are the last piece of that puzzle.  I've uncovered the details on Project Vulcan. It's a new subterranean warhead delivery system.

I'm sorry, Basil, I thought she was a man.

All right, Austin, I think you should go.

I'm leaving!  Oh, and Austin?

Be careful.

Well, Austin, you've stopped Dr. Evil from destroying the world with his subterranean nuclear probe, and somehow you and Agent Kensington managed to escape unscathed from his evil lair.

Congratulations, Field Agent Kensington!

Here's the number of my dentist, he's first rate. Ring him up, he'll look after you.

Hey Austin Powers, it's me, Mick Jagger.

Are you more satisfied now sexually, Austin?

"You can't always get what you want!" That's a great title for a song! I'm gonna write that, and it'll be a big hit.

Good afternoon, Mr. Powers, I'm the Destructacon 5000. I'm programmed to prevent you from progressing beyond this point. You might as well surrender. Resistance is futile. Your odds of survival are 23,763,273 to...

Yes, I am programmed to answer any question.

That does not compute.

Dr. Evil, do you really expect them to pay?

That's why right now is a very groovy time, man. We still have freedom, but we also have responsibility.

It seems the tables have turned again, Dr. Evil.

Mr. Powers, my job is to acclimate you to the Nineties. You know, a lot's changed since 1967.

Pretty groovy Jumbo Jet, eh? How does a hot chick like you end up working at the Ministry of Defense?

That's fascinating, Vanessa. Listen, why don't we go into the back and shag?

I've been frozen for thirty years, man, I want to see if my bits and pieces are still working.

My wedding tackle.

My meat and two veg.

Brrrr! She must be frigid. There's two things I know about life: one, Americans will never take to soccer. Two, Swedish girls and stewardesses love to shag!  They're shag-mad, man! Let me ask you a question, Vanessa, and be honest.

Do I make you horny?

Do I make you horny? Randy, you know. To you, am I eros manifest?

You've preserved my Jag! Smashing!

Hey, who put this in here? Someone's playing a prank on me!  Honestly, this isn't mine.

I love Las Vegas, man. Oh, I forgot my x-ray glasses.

I can't see a bloody thing.

Why did you leave so soon?

Good morning, luv, who are you on the phone with?

Good morning, Vanessa! I hope you have on clean underwear.

A limousine has just pulled up.

Hello, hello. That's Dr. Evil's cat.

Let's go get him!

We can't just sit here, Austin.

I don't get it.

I hate having my picture taken.

Fancy a nibble?

Watch out, you're on my hair!

I haven't had fun like that since college.

Why?

Always wanting to have fun, that's you in a nutshell.

You're smashed, Vanessa.

Oh, yes you are.

I can't. You're drunk.

Really, Austin!

Austin, may I have a word with you?

Listen, I know I'm just being neurotic, but I can't shake this suspicious feeling about that Italian secretary, Ms. Fagina. I mean, I don't want to sound paranoid, but I've had some bad relationships in the past, and I have some jealousy issues. You went to her penthouse. It makes me feel so small to give into these insecurities, but I can't help but feel this weird, irrational, unfocused... well, jealousy. I'm sorry.

I can't believe you made love to her just like that. Did you use protection?

Not in the Nineties.

Well, it means something to me. If you want us to have a relationship, you've got to be a one-woman man.

Hello, luv.

Yeah, I can't believe Liberace was gay. Women loved him, man. I didn't see that one coming.

Since I've been unfrozen, I've had a rancid taste in my mouth. Do you have a piece of gum?

Who?

No! Don't lay your hang-ups on me, Vanessa. You're being very trippy.

Austin, we don't look anything like our photo badges.

Thank God, Austin, we made it.

Does that make you horny?

All right, I get it. I have bad teeth. You have to understand, in Britain in the Sixties you could be a sex symbol and still have bad teeth. It didn't matter.

Not a good time to lose one's head.

That's not the way to get ahead in life.

What do we do now?

I'll hurry back.

Austin, what's your point?

It's not what it looks like, Vanessa.  At ease, boys.

I can explain. They attacked me. Gas came out of her...well, and then they... and I...

Austin, I'm coming with you.

I have something to tell you.

I love you, Austin.

Kiss me.

Danger Powers, personal effects.

OK, Austin Danger Powers: One blue crushed-velvet suit. One frilly lace cravat. One gold medallion with peace symbol. One pair of Italian shoes. One pair of tie-dyed socks, purple. One vinyl recording album: Tom Jones, Live at Las Vegas. One Swedish-made penis enlarger pump.

One credit card receipt for Swedish- made penis enlarger pump, signed Austin Powers.

One warranty card for Swedish-made penis enlarger pump, filled out by Austin Powers.

Everything seems to be in order.

Here, have a piece of gum.

Don't mind if I do.

No, no, I want you to have it, even if it's my last piece.

Commander, this is Slater in SoWest Com Three. We have a potential bogey with erratic vectoring and an unorthodox entry angle.

No. Log Com Bird Twelve says its metalurg recon analysis is a standard alloy, not stealthy, not carbon- composite.  It does have an odd shape, sir.

Commander, I have to log it...

But my design was perfect!  Your autonomic functions were shut down, and even though your arm wasn't frozen, the aging was retarded, therefore your right arm is only slightly older than the left.

But Dr. Evil, all you need to do is--  --work with this tennis ball. Squeeze it for twenty minutes a day. A few months of that and it'll be just as strong as the other arm...

We could not anticipate feline complications due to the reanimation process&emdash;

Ahhhhhhhhh!

We've got a lot of work to do.

Some of you I know, some of you I'm meeting for the first time.

Ow! You shot me!

Remember when we froze your semen, you said that if it looked like you weren't coming back to try and make you a son so that a part of you would live forever?

Austin Powers is getting too close. He must be neutralized. Any suggestions?

Breathtaking, Frau. These automated strumpets are the perfect bait for the degenerate Powers.

Quite impressive.

Release the sharks!  All the sharks have had laser beams attached to their heads. I figure every creature deserves a warm meal.

Yes, what is it? You're interrupting my moment of triumph.

What is it now?

I have one simple request-- sharks with friggin' laser beams attached to their heads, and it can't be done? Remind me again why I pay you people? What do we have?

No, the boy's right. I really am evil.

The details of my life are quite inconsequential.

Hi.

An evil vet?

An evil petting zoo?

Fascinating. What are your plans for this evening?

And that's how you want to live your life, is it?

Scott, I want you to meet Daddy's nemesis, Austin Powers.

In due time.

Fine. Whatever. Mutated, ill-tempered sea bass it is.  Come, let's return to dinner. Close the tank.

No, we'll leave them alone and not actually witness them dying, and we'll just assume it all went to plan.

Come, everyone, let us repair to the main chamber. Project Vulcan is about to begin. Scott, are you coming?

Don't you want to see what Daddy does for a living?

What did you say?

Dad, we just made a breakthrough in group!

I hate you! I hate you! I wish I was never artificially created in a lab.

We also own the Franklin mint, which makes decorative hand-painted theme plates for collectors.  Some plates, like the Gone With The Wind series, have gone up in value as much as two-hundred and forty percent, but, as with any investment, there is some risk involved.

Um, Dr. Evil, Prince Charles did have an affair. He admitted it, and they are now divorced, actually.

Umm, that also has already happened.

Virtucon alone makes over nine billion dollars a year.

Oh, hello Vanessa. How was the flight?

How's Austin?

You didn't...

I'm proud of you.

Well, God knows he tried, but I've been rather firm with him, Mummy. You didn't tell me he was so obsessed with sex. It's bizarre.

What about his teeth?

Did you ever want to?

You didn't answer my question, Mum.

So, Scott, why don't we start with you. Why are you here?

We don't judge here.

And how do you feel about that?

What do you want to do, Scott?

I just think, like, he hates me. I really think he wants to kill me.

We're not yet open for business, I'm afraid.

Of course. Natural weather delivered to your door on demand. Down your phoneline. For limited periods.

As real as you wish. Hot or cold. Humid or dry. Anything you like. Within reason.

The technology is brand new. Soon it will be more powerful. We anticipate a huge demand. Leave us your number. We'll be in touch.

I want you to say the first thing that comes into your head when I say these words. Do you understand ... ?  Blue ...

Red ...

Flower ...

Nature ...

Secret ...

Hope...

How long have I been here?

Would that I could say the Same.

I've come to apply for membership in Brolly --

You

Ah, beautiful. Just as he promised.

Mrs. Peel ... Come quickly. Brolly's been betrayed! I'll tell you everything ... The weather's getting worse and worse ... they're after me ... coming for me ... come quickly!

I'm afraid that's impossible.

You are female?

Then you can't come in.

No women. Not in Boodles. Not since 1922.

Quite a collection.

Your voice -- it's so familiar ...

Quite right, but we still make the rules.

People, too.

Close. We're so hush-hush, even we know nothing about it.  Now let's see, there's coconut cake, date and walnut; I recommend the rum baba ...

My number two. Special assignments. She's --

How curious ...

Welcome to mobile H.Q. Weather's turning quite nasty. Sir August was blown to smithereens. Along with half of Banffshire.  The Ministry's worried.

Would it be possible to use it for military purposes?

London. The World Council of Ministers meets soon on global defence. If you can control the weather, you control the world.

I resign.

What are you trying to do to me?

I thought I was a widow. My husband ... the only man I ever loved ... is dead. For the rest of my life I have to live with that.

Peter Peel was a first class agent. A senior operative. 'X' department Special operations. He was engaged in top secret research. Top priority.  Government approved.

Who?

This is an official matter, Mrs. Peel. No need to take it personally. Where are you going?

The doors and walls are monitored, Mrs. Peel. This is a very secure establishment.

About your next assignment, Mrs. Peel ...

Ahem. As I was saying, perhaps another macaroon ...

Good luck ... Peter ... Emma.

You.

A slight miscalculation -- my face was burned beyond recognition. Fortunately my research into plastics came in handy ...

An unholy trinity ...

For starters. Of course I had to kill the Teddy Bears, as well ...

Spoil the majority shareholders. In Wonderland Weather. I planned everything, even the Ministry recruiting you ...

Of course. I planned that, too.

You disappoint me, Emma.  Can't you guess?  For you. It was all for you ...

Think of this as your second wedding feast ...

You know, I believe she's actually jealous.

Right, bridesmaid. Now what have I left out? Oh, yes, I know: the ring.

Such as?

The result would be ...

Then what's stopping you?

The missing piece of the jigsaw. I tried to get you to give it to me as Peter; I tried to steal it from you as Dr. Darling. As myself I'll be a bit less subtle.  With this ring my plan will be complete.

Speaking of Peter, there's more good news: You won't even have to change your last name. You'll always be Mrs. Peel.

Choices?

Doctor Peel, I presume?

I was about to throw in the towel.

I shouldn't wonder. Not a woman inside Boodles since --

Red herring would have been too obvious, don't you think?

Congratulations, you've penetrated a bastion of male privilege. I guessed you weren't a stickler for Tradition, doctor.

Dyed in the wool. But I can admire someone who doesn't play by the rules.

Not by me. Play by the rules, Doctor, or the game is nothing.

I say, this is all terribly formal. Must I go an calling you Dr. Peel?

Much better.

I didn't. Mother did.

... Showers followed by sunny periods.

Ah ... From Trubshaw's.  My shoemaker.

Do you?

I thought we were on our way.

You can but I wish you wouldn't ...

That place is so absurd, so out of date ...

You know what I mean. This car -- and you. Nobody walks around like that. Milk?

But why? What's the point?

And I suppose you're the knight.

Sir August Merryweather ... why are we seeing him first?

Do we always follow Mother's instructions?

Just what is your position, if you don't mind my asking.  How did a stuffed shirt like you get into this line of work?

No thanks.

Not so much eccentric. More barking mad. He has a wife called June. And a daughter somewhere -- Julie.

The family does seem to be somewhat meteorologically inclined.

So ... I distract him while you snoop around? How?

Ah, Brenda ...  Mrs. Peel?

Strange.

I wasn't about to.

Mother and Dr. Darling have me under observation. They think I tried to kill you.

You told them. You said I arrived on a camel, shot you four times. Left you for dead.

But that's absurd. I may not be over-fond of you, Steed, but it's not my style.

That's possible. Sir August was convinced he'd met me before. But I'd never met him. Another odd thing. When it rained, he said it was just as someone had promised.

An invitation. To a 'formal picnic'...?

I must say, you look more your old self --

Either way ... may I ask: why you dress in that fashion?

Colonel Crabtree. International Satellite Systems. Formerly of the Ministry.

Elementary, Mrs. Peel. Trubshaw isn't the only shoemaker still practicing his trade ...

What on earth?

Well, he was a fellow of the Royal Zoological Society ...

Common knowledge, Mrs. Peel ...

But

Not quite. This is my field.

Exactly. There'd been earlier attempts to pump carbon dioxide into deep sea. Propane gas mostly. In small quantities it captures chlorine. Protects the ozone layer. But it proved impractical. Too bulky ...

That's what we were working on.

Three agents killed by bad weather...

Then a mad millionaire. Head of a secret defense establishment. A group of eccentrics obsessed by weather ...

Is that what you think?

This must be the last straw.

Someone didn't want us to get to the party.

Steed ... !

Where am I?

Was I?

You followed me.

I could save you the trouble.

Because you always obey orders ...

Yes ... ?

And do you trust me?

Mmm ... what are you doing?

But you did suspect me.

You're playing games.

I thought you played by the rules.

Please don't tell me it's how you play the game.

No, after you.

I told Mother I took care of you.

Drat. Someone wants to implicate you in this affair, Mrs. Peel. Any idea who?

Teddy bears, cuckoo clocks, toys All children's things ...

Quite. Any childhood friends? Enemies?

Very well. I have a friend who might be of assistance. He's at the Ministry. We'd better be careful.

His name's Jones. 'Invisible' Jones.

Aren't you coming?

We must hurry, Mrs. Peel ...

There's a reception this evening. Colonel Jones thinks it advisable we attend.

What is it?

When all this is over, we simply must get you out of that suit.

Trubshaw again? What now?

They're playing your song, Mrs. Peel.

Bad news. Father's looking for you. Where are those bloody ministers?

I'll be back ...

Oh, and by the way, I think it's about time you got rid of that chip on your shoulder.

A fine night, Mrs. Peel ...

English weather. You know, after all we've been through, I should say we deserve a long holiday ...

I don't recall Siberia being this warm, Steed.

Our little paradise -- just made for two?

Ah ... sun tan lotion. Any shops nearby?

Your mission is simple. Find out how and why these agents died.

Where's Mother?

You don't believe him?

Ah, here we are. Steed asked me to play a hunch:  Valentine Peel.

Now let's see ... Eton, Cambridge ... research into robotics and plastics. Overtaken by Peter's work on the physics of climate change ...

Do you also know that during your final experiment, your halfbrother- in-law was under surveillance?

Father. She gave him an 'all clear' after a security test by Dr. Darling.

Makes two of us.

I was getting to it.

The World Council of Ministers meets tomorrow to convene the new global defense initiative --

'X' marks the spot. The shoes were delivered to ... an island in Hyde Park. Surrounded by the Serpentine. On the site of a former Ministry installation...

Privately owned by ...

Very good, Mrs. Peel ...

Oh, hello ...

Steed

You reek of Mrs. Peel's Black Leather ...

Mother betrayed me. She was going to replace me with a younger Father.  Errand boy that's all I was. 'Find Steed...'

Your research into climate engineering was state-of-the-art. Your experiments could have revolutionized our knowledge of global warming -- had they succeeded. We need your expertise.

Think she really killed those agents?

Amnesia?

Why?

Something went wrong. System malfunction. Explosion. Mrs. Peel had a narrow escape. Suspected sabotage. Nothing proven. File still open.

Still doesn't. Better safe than sorry.  She was in a dangerous game, Steed. High stakes. She may prove to be a risk.  If she is, there's only one solution.  Termination.

This man -- did you see him?

I was hoping you could tell me.

I'm going to follow up on a hunch of my own. If I'm right, Mrs. Peel is innocent and you have a mole.

In your operation.

Are you alright, young man?

Cocky little bastard. I hope he was a baddy.

I'm Alice. Mother said you'd be on your way. Mrs. Peel with you?

You with Mother or Father?

Good. Glad to see they're together at last. They don't get along. Promotion. Top job. Most unfair. Quite a fuss at the Ministry.

Wonderland Weather Ltd.

Mrs. Peel -- ?

No, please! I beg you ...

Let it be rain, please let it be --

John Steed.

The last one you'll ever see.

You're better than I expected.

Bang-bang ... you're dead.

Rules are made to be broken.

You said ... one shot.

Aren't you forgetting about something?

I think she really likes you ... Where's Mrs. Peel?

What's happening?

Does Cole know about this?

I'm totally blown away. You're getting married. It seems like only yesterday I showed you how to have oral sex.

Look at that guy. What a hunk.

Debbie... I don't believe it. I'm so excited.

He still thinks I'm going with him. I'm going to break the news to him tomorrow.

What do you think's gonna go on at the guys' party?

What do you mean?

You're kidding.

That's what we're going to find out...

Deb, we're pretending to be hookers.

I'm glad you guys came by... What's the occasion?

What?

Yeah, man. Let's throw a bachelor party with drugs, booze and broads.

Where's the women, man? We gotta have women.

Hey, you guys, what's going on?

I've decided not to run for President.

Man, you're losing your audience.

Yes, gentlemen. Saturday after next, I lose my amateur standing and turn pro.

You sure Gary's got this whole party deal together?

I hope so. Hundred bucks apiece is a lot of dinero.

All right!

Denmark makes great Nautilus equipment.

And...

Cole. Don't you know it's bad luck to see the groom before the wedding?

Cole...

What's Debbie's blue book value right now?

Okay, ten thousand plus a G.E. toaster oven, a Litton microwave, a Cuisinart...

Michelin tires... brand new. A set of Sears Best metric tools...

Thanks, Dad.  Cole, go away.

Rick, I want to talk to you.

I don't want any trouble.

Great car.

I love that car.

I'll trade you my Porsche for Debbie. An even swap.

I mean it. The car is yours. Dump Debbie.

Low mileage... Handles like a dream.

Shit, shit, shit, shit. My car's gone!

Cole, what the hell are you doing?

He and Debbie stand outside the theater, which is a multi-plex cinema. Fourteen movie theaters under one roof. Prominent is a sign which reads: "24 HOUR 3D FESTIVAL!" Cole drags Debbie into one of the theaters. The gang runs up to the theaters.

Hello?

Yes, son, did you find out where the bachelor party is?

Fine. How's everything going?

Hi, everybody. Am I late?

Nice shot.

I know you're as unhappy as I am about Debbie's marriage to Rick.

Cole, I don't want you to give up on her.

Thanks for the advise, sir.

So, he's playing hard ball. Well, two can play that game.  Go after him. Stop at nothing. You hear me?

Right.  Hey, shut up. Okay, sir.

Cole, my God, boy, what are you doing here? What happened?

Take hold of yourself. What room are they in?

All right, I'll go up there and take care of this myself.  You look awful, son. Go find yourself some clothes.

Cole?

No, Cole, I...

Cole, listen to me... I've got to tell you...

Cole, I'm marrying Rick.

That's all right, Deb. Go be happy and smile a lot, Deb. Do it for me.

What are we having?

Not as much fun as the bachelor party the guys are throwing for me.

Of course. I'm a traditional guy... It's a traditional event.  Well, what do you think?

Yes, but looks are deceiving...  Not in this case, however.

Oh, those. Why do you ask?

Huh? Wha...

Stop fooling around... I need to talk.

I don't know... I just feel scared.

The wedding, my parents, your family, our friends, my job, the future, our relationship, the caterers, my gown, your tuxedo, our honeymoon, the apartment, my shower, your bachelor party...

Before or After I have my nervous breakfown?

That feels so great.

Um... that's very relaxing.

Wouldn't think of it. Because tomorrow...  We're going to the chapel and we're...

This is it, lady. Last stop.

Remember, you promised... no screwing around.

Okay, I promise... I swear on my mother's grave.

Don't turn on the lights, sugar.  I'll lead you around.

I can't trust you!

Let go of me!

The marriage is off. Now you can screw around with your friends for the rest of your life.

And I want to be with someone who understands the meaning of the word commitment.

See? And these are not just ordinary party-goers -- there are professionals in this crowd -- I didn't want any of them. You... You're what I want. Understand?

Are you okay?

This has been quite a night. Here's a thought. Why don't we go home and give our private parts a workout?

If I were you, I'd worry less about the shower and more about Rick's bachelor party.

Of course you do. I trusted my ex, Mel, too. Cousin, I can only talk from experience. What do you think they do at these parties, have tea and play scrabble?

Are you sure this is a good idea?

That doesn't mean it was Rick's party.

Let's go.

I'm using the same caterer for the shower I had for our Christmas party last year.

Why is Cole here?

A strange wang right in my palm.

I hope Ilene's all right.

Ed, we're so glad you could come over at the last minute and judge our little beauty pageant.

Congratulations on your daughter's wedding. Who's she marrying?

Great bathing suit.

Thanks for helping us out, Ed. We appreciate it.

Park View Hotel, Room 1002.

Jumbo, where the hell are the women?

Your whores never showed up.

That's it, prick lips.

I've had it, numb nuts... How much money you got?

This is bad public relations. I was planning to do a lot of business with you. But now I'm going to have to go elsewhere.

Give him the works.

Screw you... Screw that... Don't jerk me around. You promised me 1500 seats for the Police Concert... 1500, not fifteen!... Screw that... Screw you -- Screw Sting.  Hi, guys.

Let's go.

Wait a minute. You been living with Debbie! Why do you want to get married?

Sounds swell... I'm really touched. And my getting married's not gonna change a thing between me and my pals. We're still gonna go bowling on Tuesdays, play cards on Fridays and wear women's clothes on Sunday night. I love you guys... I always will.

Give the guy air. Everyone to a neutral corner.

It's true.

Guy paints a beautiful picture.

Looks like the only one who got screwed here was you.

Hookers beat you up?

What can I be doing for you?

That I got. Very good women. They sit on your face, anything you want.

You are being in luck. Customers in same hotel. I let you have them at cut-rate price for 45 minutes.

Not one minute longer or Milt will come for you.

So, Larry, how have you been?

You want to share it?

My marriage is the worst. All crap. A big pile of shit.

She hates me. It's over. You'll see, as soon as you get married, everything changes. You sure you want to go through with it, man?

Guys, I think I'd rather stay here.

I just want to be alone.

Lar... sometimes when people are mad they say things they don't mean.

Really?

What the hell are you doing?

You're trying to kill yourself with an electric razor?

Well, this is terrific. Now you're gonna have wrists that are smooth and kissable. Just go out there. Forget about everything and laugh it up.

It's my fault. He's dead because... I left those drugs...

It's on the tenth floor.

Oops!

Rick, hit the ball easier, son. You don't have to kill it.

Well, I have to admit my game's a little rusty, but I love polo. It's unrelenting, a constant challenge to the senses. Really a beautiful experience.

I'd love that.

Welcome, welcome, one and all.

Ebbie. Ger... umph... lable...

Er... perhaps we ought to stop now.

Girls, why don't we go inside for lunch.  Boys, would you mind bringing in that lemonade?

The thought of that person marrying my daughter makes me want to upchuck.

You've been having strange sex...!

I'm getting one heck of a glare off your dress there. Could you undo a few buttons?

Where the hell is he?

We'll spend an hour with "Nymphos Without Pants"...

Don't you love it when old friends stop by?

I'm not really hungry.

What the hell is that?

Under the table!

I don't get it. Why didn't you go for it just now?

I got something you can't resist. I have a friend, Tracey. She wants to meet you. She loves to please.

Right in there, pal.

How'd it go?

Who was that?

What's this?

How 'bout this?

He look familiar?

Now, don't get into any trouble.

Hey, you guys...

What are you going to do about it?

Reach out and snort someone.

Guess who's here? Another surprise guest.

Debbie.

I don't know... Go up to her, make like you don't know her and send her into the other bedroom.

You always were sneaky, Stan, very sneaky.

True, you're a lot handsomer now. Don't you have enough blood already?

That's an even trade... a cotton ball for all my blood.

Nah, that's okay. My brother has to look up old people's asses all day long. Let's give him a break.

Thanks a lot, that was the best. You're next.

Oh... it's... er... the guys from the beer convention. We're bringing them to the party.

You're late again, Rick.

What? I thought you told me you had it all figured out.

Can you believe how perfect it fits?

Oh these moments do try me...

That's Franny. She likes firemen.

Goddamn it, Stephen, lay off!  You stupid dumbshit, you never know when to fucking quit, do you? You ever wonder why your career's in the fucking toilet? Why you're gonna be stuck a Lt. for life?

You know Knowlton pretty well?

Biggest in two battalions.

Adcox, go with Pengelly and check the other side.

-- What the hell's the matter with you? You always check the other side. I haven't got time for bullshit right now, okay? We got a job here.

-- Knock it off!

...What do you want me to do, Stephen? Talk to me. What am I supposed to do?

You stupid son of a bitch! What the fuck are you doing!

Hey, baby McCaffrey. First one's the clincher. You did okay.

Ah, everybody screws up some, Brian. You're working for the toughest Lt. on the job. Saw him once pick up a probie he thought was moving too slow and throw him into a burning building. It's just bad luck you're family.

Is he...

You gotta let me finish --

-- He killed people --

-- Stephen, this is bullshit --

It doesn't go like that.

Well, look what we have here. Nice costume. Rent it?

Doesn't work on you.  See ya around, little brother.

I like what you've done with the place.

Been ripping off fire stations?

My God, an actual operating 8-track.

People actually used to pay you for this?

Sheep don't count.

Why'd you come here, Brian?

What is it with you, man, huh? How do you manage to keep coming up with new and amazing ways to screw up? That scotch bullshit? Am I really supposed to believe you came crawling back home because you suddenly felt heart strings moan for the family biz? You were bankrupt, man.

I know you cold, Brian. The scary thing is, you probably could have faked it for awhile. But you see, in this job there's no place to hide. Isn't like selling log cabins. You have a bad day here -- someone dies. And that's not fucking good enough. Want another beer?

Y'know, I told myself a million times I didn't want to be a fireman. I said bullshit to that line about tradition and family legacy. I know I split, and I know how you felt...

I gotta do this, Stephen. I gotta know.

-- I was doin' it! I was up there fucking doin' it. You don't know, man, you don't know what I did!

C'mon ladies, let's roll some hose...

Thanks.

Hey.

So you got a 'roid going with Jackson or what?

Look, Brian, a photographer. Maybe I can get on the cover of LIFE magazine, too.

Roll the hose.

What, is it the stairs? Christ, I'll let you win next time.

No, Lt., I don't have a problem with drilling. But let's just have one drill. Not one for the company and one for me.

Ready?

You okay?

Look, you are sorta making yourself fair game.

...Not now, Brian.

I had that fire. He didn't listen!

Hey, what are you doing here?

Well, long as you're here you can help clean up a little. I've got a guy coming to look at this in a few minutes.

Yeah, it's just another memory in my life right now. And I got way too many of them...

Yeah? What have you got to do?  Look at you. Look at your face. All the things you must be thinking. Man, you must really hate my guts. Well, you know what? It's okay.

It's okay, Stephen, I --

I saw it.

When dad died, I saw another fire...

I saw it before it got them. I tried to yell, but... He asked me to look out for him. And I didn't do it. I let him die.

I hate him so much sometimes, Stephen. You don't know how hard it was for me to put that uniform on...

Oh God, Stephen, what's going on with you?

-- Stephen, wait a minute. I gotta talk to you. It's Adcox, he's --

I saw Adcox's back! I saw the burn! I put it there! Jesus Christ, Stephen, he's been killing people!

How do you know?

-- What were they doing there?

Anything else?

I'll handle it.

You're his Lt., Stephen...  Are you gonna handle it? Are you Stephen?

You crazy son of a bitch, why couldn't you stay behind a desk where you belong?

Don't tell them about Adcox... Don't let 'em...

Brian.

You're back.

Thanks for calling.

Huh.

Not quite. Just visiting. I live in Lincoln Park now.

I work for city hall.

Well, if nothing else, it's nice to know we can still be friends.

With grenadine, right?

Let me tell you something. Martin Swayzak is going to be this town's next mayor.

Why do you think Marty came here tonight? Because he cares about your department. You don't know how hard he works. You don't know about his programs helping West Side --

What was that? Oh man, you have picked up a few moves since John Paul II Boulevard.

Boy, took you all of thirty seconds to blow that.

Brian, do you always have to be so stupid? Think about your future for once.

Look, I didn't mean to take a piece out of you back there, I just thought you'd call when you came back. You didn't and...  Don't blow it just because of this garbage between us.

Arson.

Hey.

I could use a date.

Hi.

If you weren't at least the 300th person to ask me that, I'd probably be pissed.  Boy, you sure know it's a man's world sometimes...

You think that's really any of your business?

No, he's more of a dinosaur. Guy's not a dummy, though. He's juggling alot of balls on this one.

Jesus, give him a break. There isn't enough proof yet to go public. Sure, we found some chemical shit we think somebody dumped in the plugs to torch 'em, and we've maybe figured out why backdrafts, but you can't rush this stuff. Not 'till it's locked.

See that trap door up there? That used to lead to the hay loft when they had horse-drawn engines. It was pretty different then... but kinda the same, y'know?

When I came back, I knew more than anything else that I wanted to be a fireman.

Brian. What's wrong?

Will you please keep your voice down, there's people --

I was doing my job.

Oh yeah, he's the real fireman.  Who are you? Just another probie working for Swayzak --

We still talking?  Look, I'm sorry about the other day --

I don't know anything about it.

Do you know what you're asking me to do?

Y'know, four years ago I was working in a bakery. Two years ago I was bringing Marty coffee and he didn't even know my name. I run that office now. Marty believed in me and I believe in him. You want me to just throw that away?

What is --

I'm sorry.

I think your boss is going to need some spin control.

What'll you do?

Brian McCaffrey...  Oh this is really a treat. Brian McCaffrey. Lost a dad to the animal, huh?

Okay, here's the deal. I'll tell you a story, you tell me one. Fair?

Your first question should be who isn't. It isn't a spark, Brian. Not enough damage. And an insurance pro? Where's the profit margin?

-- No no, your turn. Tell me a story.

You gotta tell a story too, Brian. It's fair. C'mon, don't think too hard --

That's a probie answer. You're smarter than that, Brian.

Who the fuck is doing this?

I want another shot, Sir.

I need another one, sir.

Uh, I'm Brian McCaffrey. Your new assistant.

Are you still here?

Then go find a corner. I don't want you in my way.

-- Shhh.

So you were happy here. Warm and cozy and in no hurry...  Soot high, clean unburned wall low, indicates slow burn in thermal balance.  Find me some glass.

Glass found in ignition room is in small, thin pieces, indicating explosion. Lack of discoloration indicates a long, slow burn. Explosion must of come after a slow burn.  You little tease... What were you up to you little bastard, huh? What made you that mad?  Or scared.  It started in this room. Took its time, hung out... but the air ran out. It couldn't breathe. So it was snuffed. But it wasn't dead... still all that trapped heat, lying low, waiting for some sucker to open the door and give it that one gulp of air...

Temperature in this room was about 2000 degrees, but copper wire in outlet is melted, which requires 5000 degrees. An accidental short in the plug could of created a spark of 7000 degrees, hot enough to melt the wire and start a fire.

Uh, I don't think that's in my contract...

Read.

-- Go to the bottom. Under heat properties.

Son of a bitch tears 'em apart just to eat the oxygen. Wouldn't take much at all to melt ten gauge wire. Problem's burnt magnesium leaves a powder trace -- unless you could find something that would eat its residue.

Look, it isn't proof, okay? Someone may have put the chemical in the outlet, but we found it as a vapor in Cosgrove's clothes.

Even if it was used to seal the air off, that doesn't explain why someone would go to the trouble of a backdraft. A gun's a helluva lot easier

I don't guess.

That's it! Oh, that son of a bitch, he's different, goddamn it! You see what this tells us, huh? Our killer doesn't love fire!

I got it after we talked to Ronald. Torches. Want to fry the whole goddamn world. But the fires that killed those guys never really burned up much. -- The burns were all lit in outlets surrounded by double firebreaks in the walls. And he made his burns backdrafts. 

But he could have killed everybody there. The firebreaks kept it from spreading in the wall. The backdraft blew out the flame. That's it. That's the reason.

No, we have a stone killer trying to make a point.

What the hell are you doing here?

Hey boss, Dekom Trust is owned by Pan Illinois... which is majority controlled by Lakeside Dynamics... which is a division of Windy City Ventures... who's partners are...  Alan Seagrave, Donald Cosgrove, and Jeffrey Holcomb.

So Seagrave and Holcomb were accountants...

This is the copy of Swayzak's manning report that was released. Everybody on this job knows it's bullshit but we could never argue with the numbers. They're all airtight.

I've got three different drafts of the same report -- with different numbers that're all over the place. Looks like they were just making it up as they went along.

Well Brian, I guess you can say it's arson now...

Did you pull me out?

Did I say thanks?

Just wondering.

So what do you want me to do?

Your brother was a good man.

Another couple of good men get burned up for their city? Is that how it's going to read?  You're the only one that knows.

Brian?

Four months?

That's Sean? Jeez, he's a giant.

Oh, man, I'm sorry.

Yeah. Big fan.

Uh, I think there's been a mistake. I didn't save that woman.

No, you don't understand, I saved a mannequin.

I have a job.

Mr. McCaffrey...

Mr. McCaffrey... Keeping busy?

Completely out of control.

Aren't you even curious?

How'd you know? These are supposed to be sealed.

You crooked son of a bitch. Why 115?

Man. Something sure put a crimp in his evening.

Do you have to do that?

Y'know what Stephen said to me, right when all the shit was coming hard? "You never know till the moment the fire stares you down if you're just gonna do this job or be great at it".

What?

So, you surviving without me?

Well, if it isn't the littlest McCaffrey.  Hey! You break anything with that you buy it!  Sorry, there must be something wrong with my eyes. I keep thinking that's a fire department uniform.

Really. Well, let's have a look at what else was "in your blood". I always look forward to getting these, they make such a nice collage for the bar... "Assistant Director, Sales, Aspen Snowmobile Tours..."

Uh huh. And "Pioneer's Pride, Mobile Log Cabins". That was in your blood about six months wasn't it?

"Laguna Jamming, Custom Surfboards"?

And just this year, "Brian's Sound Spectrum". Your own company even. Big step.

Who's going to die?

Fireman shit?

Firehouse.

Dad!

I hate it when we gotta fucking go look for it.

Stevie? Rimgale's here to see you.

He just wants to --

We gotta roll, Stevie...

They're waitin' man.

Uh, Helen, I wanted to talk to you a second about Sean...

You can't talk about my brother like that...

Stephen, what are you doing here?

Where's Sean?

Oh yeah? How's he doing?

Give up, babe. You can't fight it. Believe me, my mom tried...

I just wanted to, I don't know, not exactly apologize for the other night -- especially since I don't remember much of it --

Sorry I hit Jackson.

He treats you okay?

I treated you better.

What's wrong, Stephen?  C'mon, you only beat up the roof when something's on your mind.  How's Brian doing?

Ah Stephen, that's what this is really about, isn't it? You always have to be right.

Yeah? When was the last time?

I'm sorry... I... couldn't sleep...

Cook and I are almost finished here. Have a seat.

Look, I'm sorry I --

-- He's gettin' good on those eggs. And y'know, he told me he actually likes the piano.

They ran the residue you scraped from both crispers' front doors. It's a combination of plumber's putty and rayophene gum. Burns almost completely away when you light it.

Anyway, down here, take a look...

See that patch of shirt? We wondered about the discoloration so he ran a spectro. On a lucky shot we picked up some traces of Trychticholorate. Nobody around here had ever heard of it.

Probably got in Cosgrove's clothes in a gas state from the fire.

Shadow.

Didn't think you'd make it.

Who's this?

Is he a fireman?  I like firemen.

You don't know him.

Knock it off. Now.

Ronald here likes telephones. Used to tape wooden matches to the bell striker and wrap it in cotton. Came up with a whole little thing there, didn't you Ronald? When you got bored, what did you do? You just started making calls... mostly day care centers and retirement homes, wasn't it?

Nobody cares, Ronald.

-- Burn them.

I'm working on it.

You don't know... nobody knows...

Alderman Swayzak.

Inspector.

When are you going to catch the prick that's doing this, Don?

We still haven't found a connection between the victims.

Is there a connection between them, Alderman?

Mr. Swayzak! How ya doin'?

I'm a little busy right now --

Brown Downtown... There hasn't been any smoking brown on the street in --

I can't get over what those guys did to her. I just can't.

Susie's not a virgin anymore.

It's horrible. They burned her breasts with cigarettes. Christ.

The Church is a fucking racket. I know how they operate. I've been part of the racket since the first time some faggot priest spilt water on my head. My Aunt Lu says I was crying all the way through. Yeah, I know their game inside out. Now I'm free of it and I'm gonna stay that way.

What's to believe?

People.

Yeah.

It's not the drugs, Ariane, it's -- it's someone who wants to kill me.  You gotta believe me!

Christ! Shit! I could kill them all with my bare hands.

C'mere. You got some good blow, right?

First I'll put your Uptown in the spoon, then, to make it more exciting, I'm gonna add some Downtown. They call this thing a speedball, honey, but then you must know that...  First time shooting up?

Can you believe the nerve of this fucking guy? He kills people for fun, and then, he puts up 100 G to bring in some guys who raped a nun. What a sick fuck. Man...

But you could do it, baby. We could use the bread...

I got it, man! I will find those kids. And I'll get the 50 G from the Church! Then the kids'll go to jail. I'll be in charge, of course. After a little while, I'll break the fuckers out -- and I'll turn them in to shithead I was just talking to. And pick up his 100 G. No. I'll hit him up for 200 G. Or 250 G. l can do it -- 'cause I've got the kids. Then, of course, there's the 180 G I'm gonna pick up on the Game tonight -- when the Strawberries win!

How come all those guys who're looking to get 50 from the Church haven't come up with shit? You got some kinda inside track?

You took the chalice.

Are you all right, honey?

So what are you doing here?

The rich kind.  Jeez, man. The way you smoke that shit is suicide.

How are you doing, man?

There. Now you've got your profit and more. You'll have more product day after tomorrow, right?

I forgive you.

I forgive you.

I forgive you.

I forgive you.

I forgive you.

Oh God, my God. it's goddamn good to be good. Forgive me. Father, for I have sinned. It's still goddamn good to be good.

Large?

Fuck yesterday's game. The World Series is seven games not six. Put in my bet.

Oh, really?

Here's the deal: You meet me tonight across from the Garden. 33rd & 8th. At the beginning of the Ninth Inning. We'll listen to the end of the game together. You bring your cash, I'll bring mine.

I want 15 on the Mets.

Hey, man. Don't give me that bullshit. Don't pussy-out on me. The Mets are a fucking lock. I wanna make some money.

OK asshole. You owe thirty grand. Now what are you gonna do?

Double or nothing? Are you fucking out of your mind?

Take your money? This guy will blow up your house and everyone in it!

Do you have the money?

I don't got it. Not tonight. You can't get blood from a stone.

Oooo... Big fucking scary guy. Just put $120,000 on tomorrow's game.

You do know that he's gonna blow up your house, kill your wife and kids --

He's gonna kill you, man. Do you hear me, motherfucker? You. Dead. Get it?

How's the case going?

The fucking rapists, man. The punks who raped that nun. The $50,000 reward from the Church! Remember?

-- that there was never any other way it could have gone.  Never any other way. So you had better just put in my fucking bet. $120,000 on the last game. The Big One. Come on! Are you a bookmaker, or fucking what?

Forgive me Father, for I have sinned. It has been two days since my last confession. Father, my sin is a terrible sin. A sin of omission. There was another sin that happened at the same time, and in the same place, but my sin I think was graver stil.

Father, if it was so trivial, so natural, so -- No. I have sinned. And you must listen if you are to prescribe an appropriate act of contrition, and to absolve me. Father, what would you do if you had but one day in which to use your arms to serve God?

As I have prayed day and night since the desecration of this church yesterday morning -- and my sin. You see, Father --

Those boys, those sad, raging boys... They came to me as the needy do. And like many of the needy, they were rude. Like all the needy, they took. And like all the needy, they needed.  Father. I knew them; They learn in our school. And play in our schoolyard. And they are good boys.

Yo, Big Black, we needs a name for this joint.

BLAK OUT.  BLAK LISTED.  BLAK BALL. Need I say more.

Keep trying.

...Benedict Arnold...

Same thing, y'knowwhatI'msayin', y'knowwhatI'msayin'!

He gots to be did.

Everybody say Ho!

My name is Honeycutt and I want to try something different.  Can you do this for me?

Alright.  Here we go.  Let's go NIGGERS!  LET'S GO NIGGERS!

Let's go niggers!

You idiot.  You almost gave me a massive coronary.

I'm not huggin' you in the middle of the street.  You must be crazy, Julius.

I'm not callin you Big Black Africa. Mommy and Daddy named you Julius.

Damn, Sis, you don't keep no food up in here in dis' piece.

So now I see where you're coming from.  Just because we ain't rapping about Gucci, Timberland, Rolex, Benz, Cristal, ho's and bitches, we're pseudo.

We're revolting against the powers that be, that been enslaving the minds and hearts of all people of color.  And we won't stop rapping till we bring about the overthrow of the government of the U.S. of A.

If you were really down you would get us together with that boss of yours.  What's his name again?

Yeah, him.

You don't have the demographics.

That'swhatI'msayin'.  I'm not blowin' my young career, brother or no brother, for you or anybody else.

If you think I'm a house nigga then that's your prerogative.  You got your ways to affect change, I have mine.  And I would appreciate it very much if you took ya field nigga ass out of my house.

The Mau-Mau's are up in dis place. That's right, the Mau-Mau's.

My righteous name is BIG BLACK.

And Big Black from Brooklyn, what do you do?

What do you do?

And another thing, you better stay away from my sister or you better...

Life is beginning to look up.  It's all good in da neighborhood.

I'm not smiling.

It's that bad, huh?  It's all over my face.

What's that?

Seconds and thirds, too.

You'd try anything.  I got first dibs.  You get ya own stuff.

DeLa - what's the matter with you.

What's wrong with him?

Why they gotta make my nose so big?

I'm not drinking the Kool-Aid.

So that's what you been doing?

You're in this up till ya neck.

You can walk away.  We both can.

Good morning, Cheeba.

De-la-croix.

Sloan and I have been looking all over for you.

No offense.

I have this concept for a TV pilot. There's no guarantee it will get made but regardless, you'll still make some money.

What kind of show is this gonna be?

What about in the mean time?  Not the in between time?

Nice to meet you.

Gentlemen, the show, our show will be satirical.  You know what that is, don't you?  Trust me on this one.

I'm starvin' like Marvin.

Hurry up, I wanna watch HBO.

Ahh, the luxuries of life.

Yo, you gotta show some patience. You want me to snap my fingers and presto chango - you're an overnight sensation.  Son, there is no such thing.

We ran out without my shoes and the floor.  I gotta get my stuff.  What about our savings?

We got evicted from our home. We've both been on the streets for the last week.

If it's not too much trouble could you order us some food?

That ain't funny.

Manray, Sloan says you're too talented to be dancing on the street.

My tap shoes.

How different?

DeLa, I'm aboard.  As long as I get to hoof and get paid too!!!

I would like to change your name.

You're now Mantan.

I want you to start using the name Mantan and not Manray if you don't mind.

Mantan?

I'm not playin' myself no mo'.

I won't do it anymore.

I'm always gonna be that.  But I ain't doing no more buck dancing.

Our guest today is Pierre Delacroix. He is the creator of the highly controversial TV show MANTAN. Let's get right into it.  You have been called by some in the community a traitor, a sellout, an Uncle Tom. Why does your show generate such feelings?

No matter how sexist or racist the material may be?

But the line has to be drawn.

Are you trying to excuse our Holocaust?

...exactly thirty-two minutes ago.

Do you know how much information can be dispensed in one minute alone?

Four minutes ago.

Do you know what C.P. Time is?

I understand Black culture.  I grew up around black people all my life. If the truth be told I probably know "niggers" better than you, Monsieur Delacroix.  Please don't get offended by my use of the quote-unquote N word.  I got a black wife and three bi-racial children, so I feel I have a right to use that word.  I don't give a damn what Spike says, Tarantino is right.  Nigger is just a word.  If Dirty Ole Bastard can use it every other word so can I.

The material you've been creating is too white bread.  White people with black faces.  The Huxtable's, Cosby, revolutionary.  But that's dead.  We can't go down that road again.

The middle class black family moves into a white suburban enclave.  The middle class black family moves into a small Southern town that is run by the KKK.  The middle class single black father raises his teenage daughter.  The middle class single black father raises his teenage daughter.  The middle class single black mother raises her teenage son.  And so on and so forth.  It's too clean, too antiseptic...

That's exactly what I think.  I want you to create something that people want to see.  Let's be honest, the majority of the people in the country are deaf, dumb and blind and I'm including 35 million African-Americans.  You know and I know "niggers" set the trend, set the styles.  This is a golden opportunity now.  These idiots have to be led to the water.

What is it you want from me?  Some plantation follies?  Some sitcom that takes place on a watermelon patch?  Some show that follows four nigger generations of junkies and crackheads?  You want me to go back to the ante bellum days?

Delacroix, I'm glad you got your mind right.

We're all happy to be here and I'm going to paint a picture for you.

The name of the show?

I'm feelin' dis'!

Don't worry about that, that's my department.  Now who do we cast? We need a star.  Can Whoopi sing or dance?

That's a great handle.

Ignorant, dullwitted, lazy, and unlucky.

Mantan is an uneducated Negro who always by some stroke of unbelievable stupidity makes his best laid plans go haywire.

Yep, you guessed it.

Protest finally forced "Amos and Andy" off the air.  Could stop us from ever getting on.

Negroes would be in an uproar.

Mantan right here is a gifted hoofer.  He has educated feet.

And every week these Alabama porch monkeys will make us cry, make us laugh, make us look at our own humanity.  Make us feel good to be alive.

That'swhatI'mtalkin''bout. That'swhatI'mtalkin''bout!  He's off the hiz-hook!

I was hoping to perhaps direct some episodes myself, if not the pilot soon after.

You're telling me some white boy is gonna direct this pilot?

Besides, what does he know about Negroes?

What are his qualifications besides being a white male and directing a hot new sexy freaky Madonna video?

In the immortal words of Derrick Coleman, WHOOOPDEEDAMNDOO!!!

I'm gonna leave you two creative geniuses alone.

I will not be held responsible for these revisions.  These changes are not the way I want to go.  This is an outrage.  This is a sham.  A violation!

I don't give a good goddamn about Finland, Norway, Sweden or wherever ya blond ass came from.

Funnier to who and at who's expense? Dunwitty, when Negroes start to run amok, the boycotts, when the demostrations commence, I'm giving them your home address.  Let's see how you like it when they picket your lawn in Greenwich, Connecticut.

Yo, DeLa, I just got the news from the CNS brass.  They saw some clips from the pilot and they're rushing it onto the air.  Yo, we're a midseason replacement, ordered 12 shows.  We're on in 3 weeks.  Didya hear what I just said, Yo?

This has to be a big mistake.

Hold on a sec, I got a call.

I gots to go, it's my Moms.

What do you want?

Go away, unless you got my money.

Son.  Good to seeya.  Good to seeya.

Pull up a chair.  Oh, excuse me, this is my lady DOT.

Good woman.  I trained her right.

I did.  I'm not an alcoholic.  I just like to drink.

That's what I'm askin'.

That's the only reason, period. They only want one certain kind of black comic.

Dem white boys giving you a hard time?

The truth is never let them seeya sweat.  You do that, that's half the battle.

Let's get him over to the bed.

I love you too, Daddy.

Glad to meet you, too.  You are all your father talks about.

How long has my father been like this?

So he drank himself into a stuper?

Don't tell him it's from me or he won't take it.

He never showed it.

How was it?

Nobody told me anything.

How did you know?

How can this be?  You and me at the same time, the exact same thought. It's scary.

Manray was under our nose the whole time.

What point is that?

Sounds risky to me.

I'm in till the end.

Can't you just quit?  Walk away?

Maybe something happened to them. Maybe they're lying in an alley bleed to death.

Hello.

What is your problem?

Why did you even come up with that shit if you didn't want it made?

I wouldn't bet against it.  My Negroidal ass is stuck between the proverbial rock and a hard place.

This is the group I was telling you about.

You've said that already.

We both lied to him.

I want to apologize about my brother and the Mau-Mau's.  I should not have imposed them on you.

So you have your small victory, now what?

What is this?

For what?

Thanks.

Is that good or bad?

Why'd you do that?

How long have you and Hambone been hangin' out?

That crazy brother of yours doesn't think so.

Oh, is he?  You getting jiggy with Mantan?

Dunwitty and I feel you've been getting too close to him, getting his mind all messed up.

This is crazy.

That was a mistake, but I don't regret it.

Otherwise.  I trust you know the difference.  You're an intelligent woman, finished at NYU.

Don't make me have to use this.

Hi, Mona.

This thing was rigged, the deck was stacked, the fix was in.  Could Don King be near?  Good thing Sloan had my back.  She's my rock.  This was going to be a whole lot of work.

I'm happy for all of us.  It's just we have a great responsibility now. The pressure is on.

That's the way it came out.  Let me ask you one question.  Have you ever been in want, in need your entire privileged life?

Can I kiss you too?

You feel good, not nervous?

Not nervous?  Relaxed?

So they can be on TV.

What are you?  A man or a mouse? Are you a punk?  Punking out on me?

You getting scared because some people don't like what you are doing?

You've made it from the guttermost to the uppermost.  Don't you know you should never let them see you sweat.  Y'knowwhatI'msayin'?

Oh, is it?  Buddy boy, in this business if people don't produce, they get fired.

Let me ask you a question, if I may. How do you think she got the job in the first place?  I don't mean to burst your bubble, Mantan the Marvelous, but Sloan is an opportunity.

Mantan, we got a show to tape.

You must think I'm some kind of fool.

You hear me talkin' to you.  The only time you come up here when something is wrong.

How's the food?

It was.  It is.  But this is a different kind of show.

Mommy, please don't call me that.

I know what's on my birth certificate.  You heard from Daddy?

To answer your question, there are a lot of Negroes in it and what is your definition of buffoons?

Please let me know when you hear from Daddy, get a number or something.

He wants you to come and see him.

Yes he did.

Richmond is not all the way down south.

Regardless, he still is your father.

I'm doing okay.  Been reading about your show, it's all over everywhere. I watched it's all over everywhere. I watched it once.  I thought you said there would be no buffoonery.

No.

I won't forget.  When are you coming up here to see your mother?

Nice to meet you.  If you don't mind me asking you - how old are you?

Where are you from?

Finland.

Yes, I know.  Jukka, have you ever seen a Negro person before?  Even had a real conversation with a real Negro before?

Ahhh!!!  I never heard of that term before.  I thought you were BLACK of African-American.  No?

This is a TV show, not a music video.

Good luck, Jukka.  Do a good show.

I know all of you have seen the overnight ratings.  Through the roof.  But in this game you gotta be one, two, three steps ahead.  I introduce you to Myrna Goldfarb. She's the best media consultant in the biz.

Myrna is here to help us plan our strategy.

The Mantan Manifesto.  Catchy ain't it?  Number One.  We gainfully employ African Americans, in front of and behind the cameras.  Two. Let the audience decide.  Three. Who put these critics in charge? These so-called cultural police? Four.  Who determines what is black? Five.  Mantan is a satire.  Six. If they can't take a joke, "F" 'em.

Let Myrna finish.

Not a class, not a thing, just picked stuff up by myself.

You sing and dance?

If that was suppose to be a compliment, I thank you.

Our guest tonight is the extraordinary, talented performer, Mantan.  Thanks for coming in.

Before we begin, I want to thank you for coming on my show for your first television interview.  You could have chosen Mike Wallace, Barbara Walters, Jane Pauley, whatnot but you're here.

Money and nothing else?

Don't you feel that is a simplistic retort?

This is my best friend Sleep 'N Eat.

No mo' "city slickers."  Ahh, can't you smell the sweet aroma of the ripe watermelons and high cotton?

Well, thank you Mistuh Sleep 'N Eat.

Cousins, I want all of you to go to your windows.  Go to your windows and yell.  Yell, I'm tired of the drugs, the crack babies born out of wedlock to crackhead aids infested parents.  I'm tired of the inflated welfare rolls while good wholesome Americans bring less and less of their paycheck home every two weeks. I'm tired, you're tired, we're all tired of these so-called bible- thumping God fearing, whore mongling Professional athletes.  Aren't you tired of these basketball-dunking, football-running, hop-hip rapping ebonic-speaking sex offenders who got ten kids from ten different Ho's?  I know I am and so is Sleep 'N Eat.

Not her, the one with the little...

Too bad.  How 'bout a dress?

Not for me, my woolly headed cotton pickin' friend for...

...that was Vicki, her best friend. Dat dress will cast ya round...

...yes she did.

...not that time...

Around...

...then what about...

...perfect...

...like macaroni and cheese...

I fell out of my bed last night.

I slept too near where I fell out.

Sleep 'N Eat, what's the matter with you?  Using all dose ten dollar words?

Hold on, you allegorical hypothesis. Don't cross words with me.

Dat's yo Uncle Ben.  That reminds me, I've seen a lot of troubles lately.

I don't know who I am.

Sleep 'N Eat, I was my wife's husband and grandchild at one and the same time.  And lo' and behold, as the husband of a person's grandmother is his grandfather, I Mantan, became my own grandfather.

I feel a song a comin' on.

People show their happiness in a lot of different ways.

So what's up with you?

The good stuff.

What else?

This is a nice place.  It must have cost a pretty penny.

Oh you do, huh?

Y'know, at the beginnin' of the century, African-American had to perform in blackface.  You ever heard of Bert Williams?  He was a great artist.

You don't read, do you?

Maybe you need to start.

Why all of a sudden are you flippin' on me?  This blackface thing was part of the deal from the git-go. Don't even try to play it like you ain't a part of all this.  You down with Delacroix.

I'll be down front.  You better start putting your face on.

What?

How did you get this gig?

And?

Oh, you gonna make me say it.

Did you ever sleep with DeLa?

Don't try to change to the subject.

I know I won't be your puppet.

Good day to you, young sir.

Is your mother not afraid on account of the highwayman to let one so young as you travel?

And, I'll tell you what, Mr. Dugan, I've been insulted grossly in this house.  I ain't at all satisfied with these here ways of going on. I'm an Englishman, I am, and a man of property; and I -- I --

There's nothing else for it.  Take your ground, Grogan -- twelve paces, I suppose?

Hoity-toity!  John Best, what's the matter here?

My companion treated me with great civility, and asked me a thousand questions about England, which I answered as best I might.  But this best, I am bound to say, was bad enough.  I knew nothing about England, and I invented a thousand stories which I told him; described the king and the ministers to him, said the British ambassador in Berlin was my uncle, and promised my acquaintance a letter of recommendation to him.

O'Grady.

This is a very good inn.  Shall we stop for dinner?

Ah!  You sly rogue, I see that will influence you.

Where's the beauty you promised me?

Upon my word, sir, I think you have acted very coolly.

Good morning, Private James.  Please come in.  I should like you to meet my uncle, Herr Minister of Police Galgenstein.

The captain was the nephew and heir of the Minister of Police, Herr Galgenstein, a relationship which, no doubt, aided in the younger gentlemen's promotion.

What is the service, sir?

You are a Hungarian; you served in the army, and left on account of weakness in the loins.  He gambles a great deal, and wins.  Do you know the cards well?

What are the Chevalier's intentions?

Has he sent the challenge yet?

You say he drives after breakfast and before dinner.  When he comes out to his carriage a couple of gendarmes will mount the box, and the coachman will get his orders to move on.

Dorothy might love me or not, as she likes, but Best will have to fight me before he marries her!

A pretty day's work of it you have made, Master Roderick.  Knowing your uncle to be distressed for money, and try and break off a match which will bring fifteen hundred a-year into the family?  Best has promised to pay off the four thousand pounds which is bothering your uncle so. He takes a girl without a penny -- a girl that has been flinging herself at the head of every man in these parts these ten years past, and missing them all, and a boy who ought to be attached to your uncle as to your father.

And this is the return you make for his kindness!  Didn't he harbor you in his house when your father died, and hasn't he given you and your mother, rent-free, your fine house of Jamesville yonder?

Have you taken my message to him?

That's a very handsome sword you have there.

And now you risk the same fate.  If you are killed, your mother is all alone in the world.

I hope to spoil this sport, and trust to see this sword of mine in that big bully's body.

I'll match any man with the sword.

Not against Castle Dugan gate, that has been off the hinges these ten years.

Look here, Roderick, my boy; this is silly business.  The girl will marry Best, mark my words; and as sure as she does, you'll forget her.  You are but a boy.  Best is willing to consider you as such.  Dublin's a fine place, and if you have a mind to take a ride thither and see the town for a month, here are twenty guineas at your service.  Make Best an apology, and be off.

Grogan gave me a wink of recognition, but offered no public token of acquaintance and it was not until two days afterwards that he called me into his quarters, and then, shaking hands with me cordially, gave me news which I wanted, of my family.

I suppose she addressed them to me in my real name, by which I never thought to ask for them at the post office.

I see you are thinking of a certain young lady at Duganstown.

There's only six Miss Dugans now... poor Dorothy.

Mr. O'Higgins, I cannot say how grateful I am for your timely assistance to my wife.

Mr. O'Higgins, we are in your debt, and rest assured, sir, you have friends in this house whenever you are in Dublin.  Mister O'Higgins, I wonder if I know your good father?

Whom have I been harboring in my house?  Who are you, sirrah?

You're an impostor, young man, a schemer, a deceiver!

Chevalier, though I cannot say how, I believe you have cheated me.

Chevalier, if you will have your money now, you must fight for it. If you will be patient, maybe I will pay you something another time.

Where is my rascal, Lazlo?

Good gracious!  What is this?

It is shameful -- infamous!  I insist upon being put down at the Austrian ambassador's house.

All Europe shall hear of this!

I have no luggage.

You are the young man who M. de Seebach recommended?

Your name is Lazlo Zilagyi?

You come highly recommended by Herr Seebach.

For whom else have you worked?

And I think he was as much affected as I was at thus finding one of his kindred; for he, too, was an exile from home, and a friendly voice, a look, brought the old country back to his memory again, and the old days of his boyhood.

The cards are now my only livelihood.  Sometimes I am in luck, and then I lay out my money in these trinkets you see.  It's property, look you, and the only way I have found of keeping a little about me. When the luck goes against me, why, my dear, my diamonds go to the pawnbrokers and I wear paste.  Do you understand the cards?

But they will prevent a meeting at whatever the cost.

I believe they will deport you.

But, if they send you away, then what is to become of me?

Gentlemen, I wish you a good day. Will you please go to the house from whence we set out this morning, and tell my man there to send my baggage on to Three Kings at Dresden?

When the Duke of Courland brought fourteen lackeys each with bags of florins, and challenged our bank to play against the sealed bags, what did we ask?

It is distasteful to kill a scoundrel -- that should be work for a hangman.

I risk nothing, for I am certain to kill him.

I entered here, monsieur, at a bad moment for you; it seems that you love this lady.

Perfectly so; and what is more, I will tell you that I love her, and that I am not of a humor to put up with rivals.

Then you yield to me.

Very well; but a man who yields takes to his legs.

No.

Never.

Not one.

That man has, perhaps, not yet been born.

Your word "empty" makes me laugh. Is it fortunate, or unfortunate?  If it is fortunate, I congratulate myself.  If it is unfortunate, I do not care, for I am not aware of it.

But if, when I love, I am unhappy, I will know that my empty heart was my good fortune.

It is only too possible.  Love requires a mutual harmony which is difficult, and it is even more difficult to make it last.

A man may need to do that, and find it amusing; but a girl is bound by other laws.

How so?

You want my heart?

To make me wretched in two weeks.

The amusing thing is that you deceive me without knowing, if it is true that you love me.

Be so good as to tell me with whom you think you are?

You will do as you please.  It seems to me that such a matter can hardly be discussed until after people know each other.  Do you not agree?

Poor man.  And, for that reason, you want to begin where people end?

Will we always leave it at this?

I know better than you do.  Love wants a more substantial fare, and if it is stubbornly withheld, it withers away.

Let us give each other complete happiness, and let us be sure that as many times as we satisfy our desires, they will each time be born anew.

Shall I tell you something -- I believed what was called love came after the union -- and I was surprised when my husband, making me a woman, made me know it only by pain, unaccompanied by any pleasure. I saw that my imaginings had stood me in better stead.  And so we became only friends, seldom sleeping together and arousing no curiosity in each other, yet on good terms for a while, as whenever he wanted me, I was at his service, but since the offering was not seasoned with love, he found it tasteless, and seldom demanded it.

Without you, my dearest, I might have died without ever knowing love. Inexpressible love!  God of nature! Bitterness than which nothing is sweeter, sweetness than which nothing is more bitter.  Divine monster which can only be defined by paradoxes.

As soon as I saw you loved me, I was pleased, and I gave you every opportunity to fall more in love with me, being certain that, for my part, I would never love you.  But after our first kiss, I found that I had no power over myself.  I did not know that one kiss could matter so much.

My Lady Cosgrove's relationship with me was a singular one.  Her life was passed in a series of crack-brained sort of alternation between love and hatred for me.  We would quarrel for a fortnight, then we should be friends for a month together sometimes.  One day, I was joking her, and asking her whether she would take the water again, whether she had found another lover, and so forth.  She suddenly burst out into tears, and, after a while, said to me:

Lady Cosgrove, you are an old fool.

I accept, but I insist on a wager. The loser must do whatever the winner pleases.

I feel the ribbon.

Why are you shaking?

I hate Miss Clancy, you know I do! And I only danced with her because -- because -- the person with whom I intended to dance chose to be engaged the whole night.

Were you obliged to dance five times with Captain Best, and then stroll out with him into the garden?

But you refused me, Dorothy.

If ever I meet him again, you shall see which is the best man of the two.  I'll fight him with sword or with pistol, captain as he is.

I am at your service, Mr. Cosgrove. How much do you wish to spend?

As much as possible?

All the same, you must name an amount.

Last month, the Duke of Suffolk spent no more.

By name only.

Have you done, Mr. Cosgrove?

Does this assignment interest you?

Was he cheated?

A meeting with the Prince of Turbingen is impossible.

What has happened, madam, to annoy your ladyship?

That fool didn't know what was the meaning of a hundred-pound bill, which was in the pocket-book that the fellow took from me.

But I shouldn't like to put you to such trouble, Mister...?

As you have been robbed of your purse, may I have permission to lend your ladyship a couple of pieces to pay any expenses which you might incur before reaching your home?

How different was her lively rattle to the vulgar wenches at Kilwangan assemblies.  In every sentence, she mentioned a lord or a person of quality.  To the lady's question about my birth and parentage, I replied that I was a young gentleman of large fortune, that I was going to Dublin for my studies, and that my mother allowed me five hundred per annum.

I have good news for you, Mr. Cosgrove.  The firm of Bracegirdle and Chatwick, in the city of London, are prepared to lend you 20,000 pounds, pledged against your interest in the Edric mines.  They will redeem the encumbrances against the property, which amount to some 10,000 pounds, and take a twenty- year working lease on the mines. They will lend you the 20,000 pounds against the lease income, which they will apply to the loan as it comes in, and they will make a charge of 18% per annum interest on the outstanding loan balance.

Considering your financial circumstances, Mr. Cosgrove, it has been impossible to find anyone at all prepared to do any business with you.  I think you may count yourself lucky to have this opportunity. But, obviously, if you would reject this offer, I shall keep trying to find a better one.

There are a few other points we should discuss.  The loan agreement can only be executed by her ladyship's signature, and provided that Bracegirdle and Chatwick can be assured of her ladyship's freewill in giving her signature.

May I be quite frank with you?

Did you buy the horse, papa?

But I will have it on my birthday, won't I?

Good night, papa.

I promise your lordship a good flogging if you even so much as go to Doolan's farm to see him.

Your bother is in America fighting the rebels.

Yes, he's fine.

I made Sir William Cosgrove's acquaintance as usual at the play- table.  One could not but admire the spirit and gallantry with which he pursued his favorite pastime; for, though worn out with gout and a myriad of diseases, a cripple wheeled about in a chair, and suffering pangs of agony, yet you would see him every morning, and every evening at his post behind the delightful green cloth.

In truth, sir, yes, but, if you must marry, then marry a virtuous drudge.

Sir William Cosgrove, with his complication of ills, was dying before us by inches.  He was continually tinkered up by doctors, and, what with my usual luck, he might be restored to health and live I don't know how many years.  If Cosgrove would not die, where was the use of my pursing his lady?  But my fears were to prove groundless, for on that very night, patient nature would claim her account.

I beg your pardon?

Gentlemen, see this amiable youth! He has been troubled by religious scruples, and has flown for refuge to my chaplin, Mr. Hunt, who has asked for advise from my wife, Lady Cosgrove, and between them both, they are confirming my ingenious young friend in his faith.  Did you ever hear of such doctors and such a disciple?

Well, if my intentions are what you think they are -- if I do wish to step into your shoes, what then?  I have no other intentions than you had yourself.  Lady Cosgrove's wealth may be great, but am I not of a generous nature enough to use it worthily?  Her rank is lofty, but not so lofty as my ambition.  I will be sworn to muster just as much regard for my Lady Cosgrove as you ever showed her; and if I win her, and wear her when you are dead and gone, corbleu, knight, do you think that it will be the fear of your ghost will deter me?

I hope that you are not thinking of leaving us soon, knight?

Sir, let those laugh that win.

Dark Valdez.

Yes.  He brought me in his carriage, and he will call for me at midnight.

He is only curious to know who you are.

He loves me, as I love you.

He will believe that it will please me if he asks about it, and I shall tell him everything except some circumstances which might humiliate him.

Can I at least have a drink?

Yeah, if you've slept.

Hurricane kept you up, too?

Bill Styles...

Don't you ever point a gun at me!

A target, Kendall, cap a fucking target. What's wrong with you?

I don't want to go --

Did -- did you --

What about Pike?

He is the only one unaccounted for.

You framed-him...

This isn't our area. Whose area is this --

Hey, I --  Holy fuck... holy fuck, what the fuck did you guys do?

You killed him you fucking faggot --

We got -- I don't know, we got separated

Shut the fuck up, you fucking faggot, You just shut the FUCK UP.

West was one thing, but this --

We finished the course and came here, then heard an explosion --  Where's Pike?

Yeah, right...

Why not?

You're under military arrest, it's not gonna happen. What's wrong with baseball?

Well, it's a game of anticipation, that's the beauty.

Right. Now, I'm gonna go get you another donut and you think about whether you want to talk more, okay?

Some.

And those were the guys who went on the exercise with you?

You smoke, Ray?

Hey, Ray! Just had a nice talk with your buddy Kendall -- seems you killed three people!

That'd be my reaction too --

Well, why didn't you say so? We'll just drop all your charges, then --

Fuck "you're serious", Raymond, you got exactly zero truck with us; right now we'd take the word of a crackhead over yours, so if you've got something to say, say it.

So Childs made some side money, so what? People are dead, Ray, and the only one we have to blame is you --

And he'd been shot.

You shot Childs and Nunez.

You saved Kendall's life --

Raymond, for you to have any chance of coming out of this, we need to locate the other bodies and examine them to corroborate your testimony. Otherwise this is just another story --

We're not finished yet --

We don't need the tapes --

Not true, Cadet, I've got a gun --

He -- He made me do it --

I guess Nunez wasn't dead after all. He came after us with a vengeance.  You know the rest.

I promised them I'd ask you where West and the others are...

He was sickly. Had that shaking thing, whatd'yacall it, epoxy?

He said he worked there --

What business?

Where?

What about the phosphorous grenade?

Back up.

Why didn't you tell us all this in the first place?

Where's the cabin?

You kept Kendall alive to corroborate your story and he did it all they way up to the end. You even gave him his own motive in case we decided to burn him, too.

Is that what I did, now? And of course, you can prove all of it.

Ohhhh, I don't think so...

Cadet, what's your name!

Dunbar you are to stand here and guard this nigger for the next twenty- four hours! He is not to be given food, water, or clothes! If he so much as moves, you are to blow his nigger brains out, is that clear?

What the fuck is going on?

He wouldn't kill anybody...

So you killed him?

Whose blood is that, Jay?

What do you mean, West's?

Where have you been, Jay?

Roberto, what the fuck?

You know it's not like that --

You gotta untie me.  I didn't do this thing, Ray.

Maybe, but that don't make me a killer --

Ray, this is my life here. I ain't gonna pretend I'm not happy West is gone, but you know I couldn't have done this. It's not in me.

We're sweeping our area and suddenly he's gone. Couple minutes later, phosphorous grenade pops off about a third of a click away --

You hated West, Mueller loved him --

Bullshit.

Why?

Combat grade morphine. Mueller sold it to me.

Why... why didn't you tell me?

That still doesn't mean you didn't kill him.

His chest was hamburger --

I... I don't know...

There's no time to think, Ray, we gotta get out of here! You untie me, we grab the guns, get Kendall and Nunez, and make a run for it --

I've done nothing wrong.  I'm the victim here.

My father is a powerful man. Over the years he's used that power to protect me, in one form or another, from certain... unpleasantries.  I am a homosexual.

He is not, shall we say, wild about the idea. He has asked me on numerous occasions to be more discreet about my proclivities, and I have done my best to oblige him. However, in the last four weeks, I began a relationship with another cadet. What do you think of that?

Maybe I shouldn't tell you that. Maybe I should tell you I wasn't scared at all. But I was...  Enough to almost kill him.

He admitted it.

Why did he come back for you?

Somebody emptied a full clip into him --

You tried to pin three stone murders on Dunbar --

Epileptic attacks are murder on your system. Rattle your internal organs like a paint mixer.

Is it the truth?

Dunbar was running out the door? Ohhhhhh... See that's where I was confused, because I thought you said Nunez was running out the door.

I believe your next line is "What are you trying to hide?"

Something funny, Levi?

Jail if he's lucky, the gas chamber if he's not --

Why?

How do you know?

Or you, Levi? When is it finally going to come out that you were the one who killed him?

You lied to us, Levi, you're going to the gas chamber unless you tell us where to find them!

How are you?

This is Warrant Officer Julia Osborne, the closest thing we have to an in- house investigator.

The exercise was one of his Section Eight "private sessions". Left around 2100 yesterday and were scheduled for pick up at 0630 this morning.

No, the problem is one's dead, one's got a bullet in his arm, and one won't talk. The one who won't talk was trading live fire with the dead one as we reached the pick-up.

Which gives us about five hours. Why'd you call me?

Tom, bottom line: I let those kids go out there. If JAG shows up and I don't have any answers for them, my career is finished --

He's not done by a longshot, I can get more out of him --

Pike killed West, Dunbar killed Mueller, Childs, and Nunez.

We've already been over the terrain twice. Nothing.

Habeas Corpus -- you have to have a body to have a crime.

Without the body we have no physical proof. We need a confession.

Nevertheless --

You mean not enough to save you.

Tom, where are you going --

You want a confession? Why don't you confess, Bill: people are dead and you don't give a shit about it! Only reason you called me is to protect your fucking job, you know this is your fault --

What I said before --

Yeah.

It's over. Time of death was 4:42. JAG's been notified and I called the Senator myself. My report will reflect that his medical condition made this unavoidable... you two had no culpability in the matter.

You think you could explain all this to me?

I'm sorry, Bill.

You're a good soldier, Bill.

It was so good, I actually forgot you're one of the bigger dogs now. The Base Commander. The one in control. You couldn't let him testify, could you?

If you let him testify then it would have all come out. West was supposed to take care of it out there, shut Nunez up and then disappear. But it got messy and people got killed. So you called your old pal Tom Hardy, figuring if worse came to worse, he'd cover for you.

Stay where you are.

What I can't understand is why you signed these. If you'd just let West take care of the paperwork, no one would have known, but you got careless. So when Pike finally told the truth you had to get rid of him, too.

Toxicology report came back. Kendall's attack was caused by a drug known as anephadrine, maybe you've heard of it. It's for asthmatics. If an epileptic takes enough, it kills them. I checked with the nurses at the hospital -- you're the only other person who visited Kendall.

You poisoned him, Bill. You heard our interrogation, you knew he was ready to crack, so you killed him, just like Pike.

No! You will stand there and you will listen! What happened to you, Bill? You were the one who joined up to do good in the world. You were the one who believed in it --

No more witnesses. West's a ghost. But it doesn't matter because we have your signature, the hospital log, and Kendall's toxicology report. And that'll be enough.

You can't duck this, Bill. I may have done every goddamn thing in my life wrong but I won't let this happen.

Hostile and uncooperative.

Ah, Christ

I didn't mean that as a compliment.

Gotta be honest, I love what you've done with the place --

He got me through Basic and a lot of other stuff. I owe him.

It was for suspicion of bribery, it's really all in the wording --

Three things. First -- You don't have a choice. Second -- I've never taken a bribe in my life. And Third -- I'm still a little drunk from last night, so if I skip over the witty banter and move forward to straight hitting on you, try not to take offense. Tell me about the two guys.

He's in interrogation?

Move him.

The Colonel saw you shoot Nunez, you're a murderer --

Baseball?

You made me look like an idiot --

You really want to make banal chit- chat like that now?

We're in the middle of a murder case --

What is that?

Something like that. You?

You do understand that there's absolutely no way I could ever be attracted to you, right?

He's telling the truth, up to a point.

Something wrong?

Remember, he's the son of a Senator, so go easy. Kid gloves.

That was kid gloves?

But we have to question him --  Thought you didn't have cigarettes --

"Too neat." How long have you been an investigator?

I just... He came back for Kendall. I don't think he's capable of murder.

Look, all we've got is what Kendall says, and he didn't actually witness any deaths except Nunez. He found West, he saw Mueller and Pike, but just their bodies -- he didn't see any crime committed.

Why the fuck wasn't he in restraints?

Styles couldn't reassign him, he's a legend --

Goddammit, Hardy, you can't just leave --

West was a monster! Fifteen years ago, I was here, I was Section Eight, I was Pike. Fuck being the knife dummy -- that thing he did, stripping Pike down, making him stand outside all night? He did that every year, he did that to me. Fifteen years ago, I wanted him dead, and now I'm supposed to care that somebody offed him? Sorry, no can do. I tried.

Why do you care?

I didn't shoot West...

At least you and Kendall agree on that.

Talk it through: Childs, Mueller, and Nunez know they're going out on the regular Tuesday Night drill, hurricane or no hurricane, so they plan it: Kill West, pin it on Pike.

They believe the innocent are guilty and the guilty are innocent.

Buttfucks the cabin?

So why, after Dunbar drags Kendall out from under a house, does the Senator's son try and get us to put his savior in the gas chamber?

Little bit.

We're fucked, I know --

What?

Are you sure?

Why don't you talk to Levi off the record for a second?

That's a fantastic idea --

I pushed him too hard.

Yeah, I could've. Should've.

No, I didn't. I wanted to humiliate him. For what he did to Dunbar. For fucking over the little guy.

You wanted to break him.

So what now?

Think it'll work?

You know, you never told me why you left the army.

For what?

We were close to something with Kendall.

No.

Four --

We got maybe three minutes till they break it down.

Hardy, what are you doing --

We can tie you to the chair if it'll work better for you --

No bodies, no West...

We need to talk --

What?

This isn't the time --

What if I don't want it?

That's not true.

You're a good man, Hardy.

West?

Do I have a choice in this?

What are you doing out here?

Nah.

A word of advice about women -- that first hour or so after they kill their boss? Probably not the best time to hit on them.

Your phone number?

He was your friend.

How?

I don't think I want to hear this --

Pike, please --

Maybe we shouldn't go.

You ever been in a hurricane, Mueller?

We should tell him we're not going.

Pike and I got separated --

I remember now, it was before the explosion --

I was freezing from the hurricane --

He said what?

No one else heard it?

Nunez was chasing Dunbar.

Pike never confessed.

Running out of time, are we? Tick- tock, tick-tock, how long till your witnesses fly the coop?

You and Dunbar got your stories straight. Little details, little inconsistencies, designed to bounce us back from one of you to the other, asking questions, killing time, until the transport arrives and whisks you away to where Senator Daddy can protect you. You think you're just going to slide out of this? You're an accessory to murder, Levi, you're going to jail --

It doesn't matter, Levi. We're going to find those bodies and when we do, I'm going to make sure one of them has a bullet in them that matches your weapon --

It won't work --

Enjoy your flight to Washington --

Dunbar's telling the truth.

Who, Levi --

I told him what had really happened to West. Told him to keep quiet about it or I'd destroy him. Because if it came out that I was involved with the whole PX scam, my father would be finished.

What happened with Nunez?

Hurricane's due after midnight and we're still going out?

What the fuck happened to you --

Whoever shot the Sarge blew a grenade first --

This place is going, Mueller. We gotta move --

We all know what you did, Pike. I don't know what kind of nigger voodoo you been working in here, but --

I used it to start the fire --

Goddammit, Ray, we gotta get out of here --

Cadet Michael Mueller, I hereby place you under military arrest for the murder of Sergeant Nathan West --

You are to be stripped of all weapons and placed under guard --

Until we return to base, and ballistics can match your weapon to the slugs in Sergeant West's body --

Tell him to shut up --

Funny. I swear I saw them bring him and the smaller guy in this morning.

This is totally unnecessary --

But this guy you called, he's not even Army --

Search parties for the others are fanning out in a ten click radius from the pickup. If they're hurt and we can get to them in time...

You think he did it?

What do you think?

You both know if you do this, if you go after a Senator's son and you're wrong... it's not just me in the hot seat anymore.

What happens to Dunbar now?

You never told me why you got kicked out of...

You motherfuckers have just made the worst mistake of your lives! You have chosen to join my Army! This Army is my mother, my father, and my little virgin sister and I will not allow anyone or anything that is not up to my standards near her pretty little virgin cooze, do you understand me -- give me a sir, yes, sir!

Those who I deem unworthy to pass through this camp will quit, and those who refuse to quit I will kill. You ever hear of a training accident -- give me a sir, yes, sir!

In my time I have killed sixteen men for the good of my country, sixteen men whose entrance into this Army I could not condone, as it would weaken the fabric of this nation's defense! This base suffers an average of three training accidents a year, unfortunate incidents that I will not hesitate to repeat if you cross me, understand -- give me a sir, yes, sir!

Great, great. That's fantastic.

Hey kid! Your friend just made himself a star.

See! The big guy likes it.

Jesus, kid.  Let me guess. Real pretty, blonde hair, blue hat?

I know her uncle. Friends of the family.

What do you mean? You don't even know me.

Someone stole my backpack.

Didn't kill anything, did I?

I was wrong about you kid. You may not have much, but what you got, you got a lot of. You could get any girl.

Her name is Sandra Templeton. She's going to Auburn. The semester's almost over, so you better hurry.

Welcome to ya. What's your name?

Bloom like a flower?

What is this place?

Now tell me if that isn't the best pie you ever ate.

I have to leave. Tonight.

This town is everything a man could ask for. And if I were to end up here, I'd consider myself lucky. But the fact is, I'm not ready to end up anywhere.

You won't find a better place!

Then do it.

Fine, you do it.

You get the eye?

Bloom!

Can I see him?

Glad to see you're not trying to have a heartfelt talk. It's one of my greatest annoyances, when people talk to those who can't hear them.

How long have you known my father?

How would you describe him?

Did your father ever tell you about the day you were born?

Not that one. The real story. Did he ever tell you that?

Did you see that woman?

Well, she... uh...

Yeah.

How old are you?

How are you gonna make it without your shoes?

Promise me you'll come back.

No one would come out here unless they had business. And no one would have business with me except for you. You're buying the town.

So I've heard.

Helping people makes me happy.

I won't be selling you this house, Mr. Bloom.

I'll...

Don't. Don't be embarrassed. I should never have let you think that...  I am in love with my wife.

And from the moment I saw her until the moment I die, she's the only one.

Really.

Means when you dream about something that's going to happen.  Like one night, I had a dream where this crow came and told me, "Your Aunt is going to die." I was so scared I woke up my parents. They told me it was just a dream, to go back to bed. But the next morning, my Aunt Stacy was dead.

Because see, my mother was banging the milkman.

He was buttering her rolls. Pumping her churn. Splashing milk in her box.

Spooning the sherbet.

You don't need a picture. Just look up handsome in the dictionary.

That's because we didn't have a wedding. Your mother-in-law was never supposed to marry me. She was engaged to somebody else.

I thought you said you didn't have a church wedding.

Is it the medicine that's making you thirsty?

There was one time when I was eleven...

I didn't forget. I was just working on a tangent. See, most men, they'll tell a story straight through, and it won't be complicated, but it won't be interesting either.

Wouldn't lie to you. And they've got all-you-can-eat buffets. You can eat a lot, can't you?

Karl.

You don't like it?

Okay.

You know anyone's who's taken it?

You're not trying to run away?

You can see my predicament. My wedding ring, the symbol of fidelity to my wife, soon to be the mother of my child, was now lost in the gut of an uncatchable fish.

Jesus Christ.

Come on, Will. Everyone likes that story.

You --  -- are in for a surprise.

No, but I hear it's terrible. Then you spend years trying to corrupt and mislead this child, fill its head with nonsense and still it turns out perfectly fine.

People needn't worry so much. It's not my time yet. This isn't how I go.

She was a witch.

There was this panhandler who used to stop me every morning when I came out of this coffee shop near the office.

And every day I gave him a quarter. Every day. Then I got sick and was out for a couple of weeks. And when I went back there, you know what he said?

When did you ever work in an office?

Dad, I'm hoping we can talk about some things while I'm here.

Your mother hasn't been keeping up the pool. If you wanted to you could...

You know where the chemicals are?

I thought you weren't dying.

Why not religion, Dad?

Josephine actually went to the Congo last year.

Did I ever tell you about how...

The maple tree and the Buick. We heard it.

But the real story is how I got the car. You see...

Son?

Do you know much about icebergs, Dad?

Dad!

I'm trying to make a metaphor here.

The thing about icebergs is you only see 10 percent of them. The other 90 percent is below the water where you can't see it. And that's what it is with you Dad. I'm only seeing this little bit that sticks above the water.

I have no idea who you are because you have never told me a single fact.

You tell lies, Dad. You tell amusing lies. Stories are what you tell a five-year old at bedtime. They're not elaborate mythologies you maintain when your son is ten and fifteen and twenty and thirty. And the thing is, I believed you. I believed your stories so much longer than I should have. And then when I realized that everything you said was impossible -- everything! -- I felt like such a fool to have trusted you. You were like Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny combined. Just as charming and just as fake.

Dad, I'm about to have a kid of my own here. It would kill me if he went through his whole life never understanding me.

What do you want, Will? Who do you want me to be?

The river.

Tell me how it happens.

Let's get out of here.

Where are we headed?

It's unbelievable.

I'm sorry.

Oh.

Daffodils?

How did you get so many?

I was drying out.

I've been working on this poem for 12 years.

I don't believe it!

So what are you up to now?

This is it? The whole vault.

Are you Jenny Hill?

How did you know my father?

Were you and my father having an affair?

Look, I don't know how much you want to know about any of this. You have one image of your father and it would be wrong for me to go and change it. Especially this late in the game.

Logically, you couldn't be the Witch, because she was old back when he was young.

You didn't become crazy.

Thank you. I'll bet you need to --

I spent a week in Morocco for the story. It was incredible.

I'm going to get started on dishes.

I'm going to check on him.

I'm sorry. It seems every hour I have to...

Do you like it, being pregnant?

It's bad.

You need to go.

What about the details? How they fell in love. The Circus. The War. You never told me any of that.

Mmm.

Do you love your father?

I need you on my side.

What happened?

How did you get here?

Ruth McHibbon offered to pick you up at the airport.

Is that Dr. Bennett's car?

How is he?

How much time does he have left?

I don't know if you've seen it, but Josephine has some photos in the most recent Newsweek.

Mom, would you say you understand Dad?

What I mean is, do you really know what's going on in his head?

How is that possible? I mean, you try to ask him a question and suddenly it's another one of his stories.  You can't honestly say you know him.

Would you say you understand Josephine?

Josephine and I have a lot in common.

Before I forget, your father has papers in the basement I'd like you to go through. I wouldn't know what's important.

Was she one of your teachers?

That really happened?

Is he awake?

Mom?

Did you and Dad have any other property?

So you never bought any land.

I don't suppose one of us could stay with him. In case he...  In case he wakes up, one of us should be there.

Mom, do you want some time with Dad?

You first.

Put it in the cases. Split it up. And don't forget you owe me £150.

The sets were good.

Sixty four thousand, eight hundred.

It's enough isn't it?

You know what I mean babe, It's enough. We can stop.

Yes.

What's this?

That's not a burn.

Do you like it?

Say thank you.

A baby? What are we supposed to do with a baby?

What? What are you doing?

What. You're what? You're with this creep now.

You have. You've actually fallen for this prick.

To customers approaching the bank from the rear

Hello.

You must find some glasses, small, for the toast, and some plates.

Sorry. You've lost me...

What did he say?

I need to know who you are first please.

And...

Hold on.

Right.

Right.

No.

So?

What was that?

So how long will you be in England?

You must have a visa or something...

She says 'Hello' to you. Go for it John!

She says she has a secret to tell.

When?

I...

What was that?

Tell me.

Tell me what he said.

You are not ashamed of it? It's no surprise to want to love.

Do you believe in love?

How is bank?

I understand. I'm so sorry

Put the fucking kettle down.

What did he say? Tell me!

What does he want. The Russian shithead. What do you want ?

He wants a lot of money.

Oh Jesus.

Just leave her alone.

It's about forty miles from here. I don't know if you've looked at a map, it's close to London but it's a city in itself. A Roman city. It's a nice house. I'm having a problem with ants. I uh... It's the warmer weather. I can't seem to find the nest. Sorry, do you understand "ants"?

I just can't find a nest. The root of the problem. I've looked everywhere. What's the Russian for ant? Sorry that's a stupid... Sorry. This is strange isn't it.

I'm pretty nervous. Are you?

So. Is it different to how you imagined it?

And how was the flight. Sorry, am I speaking too fast for you?

Do uh... Sorry. Can you follow me? Do you understand what I'm saying?

Good. Or should I speak slower?

Do you follow or should I speak slower?

Uh... Are you a giraffe?

Today is bath day.

I don't understand.

Syevodnya?

"Frenzy".

They go. John. They go.

They go.

Oh, I don't know. In my job as Deputy Assistant of New Business at the bank would have to listen to the problems of a great many individuals. This took a lot of understanding and sympathy, to try to work out solutions to their problems. But, you see, I'm not in that line of work anymore. Nowadays I'm a bank robber.

Unless. Unless this is part of the routine. You get tied up, stick around, distract me, they both bust in and Steal My Cup Of Coffee.

I don't want to know.

So what are you going to do?

They don't blame you. When a bank employee does this they understand. You get your life back. Anyway I bet you hated that bank.

Why else would you send off for me? If you just wanted sex just go to a prostitute.

In the world.

In every sense. If at all possible.

Where's the restroom?

I'm going to be sick. Where's the...

I'm going... I am... I'm going to be sick.

You don't have to do this. I can look after myself.

What?

Give me some money.

What?

So, uh, Alexei, which I know isn't his name...

Of course. Of course. Of course he does. Of course. Thank you. Thanks.

Not the kids type then is he? Not that broody. You must be pretty miffed.

I don't want to talk about it.

No.

We'll pretend it never happened.

I don't hate you.

And? What are you saying?

And who says what is wrong.

What's a moral orgasm John? Tell me how it feels exactly.

Whereas "Wet 'n' Wild" is an emotional journey. "Tied and Tethered". It's pretty moving huh? Like Anna Karenina.

So what? Do you just switch off in your head or do you imagine you're with him, or what?

Sometimes which?

Some... What does that mean?

I don't like sex. I don't think I'll be having sex ever again.

Well, it's just that the thought trying to charm up an erection in front of a woman, or alone for that matter, makes me want to die.

What?

I got what I paid for.

It wasn't what I wanted.

You don't understand me.

What? I... I wasn't saying...

I wasn't saying anything.

The rest of the world, John, it's not all like St. Albans.

You are pretty naive if you think it is.

Have you had any before?

Are you scared?

The thin... the girl with small eyes. The one in your cupboard.

Did she leave you? Come on. It's nothing to be ashamed of. Who did she leave you for? Your best friend? Her boss? A woman? Did she leave you for a woman, John?

I'm sorry.

What?

She's alive!! She is not dead?

You should stop smoking. You're pregnant. You smoke like a fucking lab dog.

I've got news for you. It's not working.

Nobody's that unhappy.

I don't want anyone to die.

I don't know.

You know you can come under the blanket.

I've got an hour. Can I buy you a coffee?

Okay. Thank you.

Yeah. No thanks.

Okay. Goodbye.

You can probably buy them on the flight.

Goodbye.

It's not mine.

Why?

No. What? No. I know.

It's a long way to go for a date.

What does it mean?

Hurry. I'll wait for you here.

My name's Sophia.

Is the flight full?

You have excellent English.

How do you want to pay?

What are you doing?

You know the rules.  You do know the rules, don't you?

Then start taking them seriously.

Lazarus?

I'm sorry. It's these soft shoes I wear for my back.

I'm standing most of my day. They're for support.  Didn't see you in church this mornin'.

Angela?

I need to uh...

My little niece... she got this deep cough.

Is your niece older than 12?

My sister got a bad cough with her pneumonia. I just copied her prescription. You don't need to pay anything... just take it. But if she gets worse, you give me a call. I wrote my number on the box.

I brung you a little basket of goodies. Fresh squash, tomatoes, some okra, butter beans.

This was very sweet of you.

I bet you have loyal customers.

Been eatin' like a princess all week. Even got enough for us to take a picnic under the gazebo.

I's thinkin' about singing in the choir.

Mm-hm. I don't know if I got a good voice or not but... practice is only on Mondays and Wednesdays, so...

When? Now? Oh. No.

Hey.

More cough syrup?

I lied to you. It was wrong. But at the time... I didn't know what to do. Imagine you got an earful from folks about that gal I's carryin'...

He black alright, he just ain't blue.

Naw. They got some blue dye, though. You think them boots you got on come from a black cow?

Hi.

You ain't the kicker, are you?

And, sir... do you have a size in mind for what you're lookin' for?

Mind I ask, what's all this business here?

For your hands?

Look it. I got somethin' for us. This is gonna help, okay.

Holy shit.

Sit down, man. Need a beer?

What happened?

I can't get Rae on the phone. She's not at home... none of her friends seen her anywhere.

I don't know. She's gettin' crazy, like she gets. Begged me not to go. Got real down. I just think somethin's happened. Like she run off with someone. You'd tell me if you knew somethin', right?

Uh-uh. I's hitchin' up the interstate when I seen your truck outside.

This don't feel right. Kitchen looks just like I left it. I know, cuz I cleaned it.

Ronnie. You can't see cuz you're too close to it.  These nervous spells you get. You never had that shit back in school...

With all she was doin'. With all the shit she kept doing! You stayed stuck to that bitch's ass and you wouldn't let go.

YOU HAD A PLAN! YOU HAD A GODDAMN LIFE! AND SHE JUST FUCKED THE GUTS OUT OF YOU!

You gonna steal my truck?

Jes? Jesse?  Oh shit... Wait... Wait... STOP!

Thought you had a skirt earlier.

This thing you got... I've heard people say, you'd fuck a tree if it was handy. I can see that.  But that nigger Tehronne. Thinks he's some player cuz he hustles dope and stolen hubcaps. I mean, I can see a tree. But that piece of shit?

The fuck you laughin' at?

Why should you waste your life waitin' and wonderin'. Not like you're married.

You wanna go home?

Better?

Think this about money still, ya old fool?

Thought we was gonna be friendly about this.

Rose. Folks get sick. But you do what you can to get on the mend. Our marriage... it just got sick. That's all.

I keep the heat on.

I deserve better than this.

Better than what you give.

Laz... You can't say nothin'...

My Daddy told me that a younger woman would bleed me dry. And that's what you did. Ya bled me.

Would'a chopped my arm off if you asked. And this how you do me!

You better pray, gal. You better pray...

YOU SHUT UP!

Ain't gonna be callin' me boy when I blow your face off.

You heard me, mother-fucker. I'll fuckin' kill..

You testing me? Huh? You testin' me, old man?

GODDAMMIT, RAE!

SHUT UP! SHUT UP!

Don't... don't say that to me...

Like a man.

Take it easy now. Don't rush it.

You been in and out goin' on two... maybe two days.

Where's Ronnie?

I don't got any money... for fixin' me up and all.

Then I better be on my way. Don't wanna put you out no more.

Naw'sir... I gotta be on my way.

Way I see it, it's gonna take a while for you to get right.

I ain't laid a hand on ya but to ease yo fever... Remember like I say, I found you in the road...

Now, no harm's come to you... and I aim to keep it that way. Ain't gonna... gonna run a train over ya... or however you call it... see... you was runnin' wild on me... these fever dreams you was havin'... these fits. I'd be chasin' you all night.

Gal, you ain't right yet.

How you let men treat ya like they do?

These men you up under. How you let them do ya like that?

You know what I'm talkin' about.  All that mess with ya teachers and... boys in the backs of trucks.

We got everything we need. Plenty of food. Ya medicine still got a few good swallows in it...

Some crazy Jesus freak, gonna fuck the spirit into me...

Look it, mister... you wanna have your way, you take it. I'll do whatever you want. But you gotta let me go. You can't do this! You can't KEEP ME HERE!

LET ME GO!

Stop it! Stop it! IT HURTS!

Wicked little bitch... gonna cut me...

No, ma'am. You stop that foolishness.

You like this? Walkin' me through this field like I's your mule?

Cuz once in a while soil need a change. Corn take up a lot of nitrate in the fertilizer. So next crop what ya do is plant ya some soy beans. That give off a lot of nitrate. Change keeps it all growin' and growin' strong.  Sting a bit?

Means ya healin'.  So all this farmin' make me think on Matthew. Matthew 13. The parable of the sower? Man toss seed on rock, on the wayside, some fell in thorns... you know the story?

The seed that land on good soil is for them who hear the word of God... and understand the word of God. Not enough for you to hear what I'm sayin', you gotta understand.

My God, gal, don't you got no SENSE? I ain't sayin' I ain't weak? Shit. Playin' guitar in the blood-bucket jukes all ya life... a nigga learn how to sin, let me tell you!  I GOT SIN IN ME! I AIN'T GO'N LIE! BUT I GOT RESPECT! AND ALL YOU GOT IS BILE, GAL!

Now that's sharp. That is sharp. Chain give you any trouble?

Gal, I been around hard-cursin' folk all my life. And let me tell you...

If all you got is filth comin' out'cha mouth... people just gonna tune ya out.  Rae. RAE! I'm not fightin' with ya. I just know you got more in you than junk.  Now, you sayin' you don't know how to cook anything at all?  You know how to boil water?

You take it straight?

Want another?

Still makin' jokes?

If you want... I can take you back to town now.

Could you do somethin' for me?

My life is gone. Only life I was livin'. And I lost it.

Tell me what to do.

Oh, Laz... he hurt me. He... hurt me so many times.

You took care of your wife, like you do me?

What is it?

Get'chu at that table up yonder.

Are you drunk?  Keep drinkin' water and you won't get a headache in the mornin'.

Laz? Can I sleep with you tonight?

I didn't mean it nothin' dirty.

Sorry.

I know that.

Go'on and sing it, I'll play.

Now that's sharp. That's real sharp. Miss Ella Mae set you up, didn't she? You like it?

I don't want you to let go.

Do you call it a game when only one man win each time? I think you call it a damn shame.

You need some weed?

That ain't up to me to hook you up. Naw what I mean? She her own, you know?

That ain't my scene. If that's somethin' you into...

See, that girl is in my favor. You heard me, nigga? You fuck with her rough, and you got me to fuck wit.

What'chu sayin'?

She a freak. Got what you call a sexual addiction.

First hooked up with that bitch when she was 16. Girl was fuckin' the principal and two of her teachers. You know coach Reynolds?

He tapped that.

You ever seen a train run on a woman?

How a girl get like that?

It got some miles on it, but my boys say she run good. Got fresh 22's on her. Ain't my doin'. That's just how it came to me. Don't worry. Nobody gonna come lookin' for it. I got the pinks... got no problem.  Ain't gonna have my girl ridin' no bus.

You ain't gonna make a fuss, are you?  Nothing a man can do when a woman make up her mind.

That kind of talk is between us. Don't you go in there with that shit on your tongue.

Bojo called. Said you got to see your brother at the long end of a broken bottle.

Was that Lincoln James I seen run off?

Why's his britches round his knees?

You get a call from Rose?

Goin' dove huntin'?

You ain't gonna talk me outta shit no more. I got my mind made up and I ain't gonna be moved on this.

Got no place for preachin' here. Not now. So you do as I say...

Are you outta ya GODDAMN MIND?

Laz, I know about that girl.  Good number of this town's sinners got my ear, you know.  Oh, Laz. She's had a mess of crabs and them STD's. What'chu thinking?

You say she was beat on. You call the sheriff on that?

Why don't you go'on and ask her. She need to talk wit somebody with sense. Folks been ruttin' and beatin' on this gal all her days. And this is how I'm handling it.

Good. Makin' steaks for supper. I expect you to come.

You treat folks special when they company. It's just supper, R.L., shit.

Pass them potatoes, Lincoln.

Gotta get that chain off her, Laz. Somethin' like this gets out, you could land in a heap of trouble.

You believe He wants this? A woman chained to ya radiator?

Then what?

The hell is this shit?

There you go, preacher man. Get me drunk so I don't stick my foot up yo ass.

Yeah, you know you home, old man. You just walked through the door.

And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love.  Who gives this girl in marriage?

You won't at the square this mornin'.

Keep the change on that.

What happened in there... that won't your fault. Ain't a young man alive could keep they britches on with that girl being in heat like she is.

That's between her and me. It's private. And I don't want you goin' off and tellin' ya daddy.

So...  That your first time?

I skipped lunch.

You know how, like they say, you save someone's life, you responsible for them. Guess he just don't think it's safe for me.

You a preacher?

But that's so fuckin' stupid.  I'm sorry. Didn't mean to curse.

You can't hurt people... and then just say, I'm sorry, and then everything just gets washed away. Why would heaven want people like that. People who... do what they want and then... switch.

It starts like this... fire... that spreads. Starts in my head. Then moves to my stomach. Then it goes lower. I can stop it sometimes but mostly I just jump on and ride it out... then everything'll go back to normal, you know. Only thing ever took that feeling away was... was... when I met Ronnie.  Cuz I love him so much. He's all I got in my life that's special. And I like taking care of him and helping him when he gets nervous. When I can do that for him... it's like I'm givin' somethin' of myself that I haven't givin' nobody else.

This ain't gonna work.

I don't see why we gotta lie 'bout it when you and I know this ain't gonna work.

It's stupid... It's so fucking stupid!

Hey.

I think if I just piss... I'll be okay.

I'm just in one of my moods. You know how I get.

I think it'd be better if you talk to me.

No. I just got a messed up stomach.

What?

I'm a what?

Ain't been a week and you already some nigger's whore? Gill told me. Told me how you and he... you and everybody...

Goddamn it, I ask you a question, you better answer it, or I'm gonna blast a hole in ya!

Didn't know you was workin' here now?

Since you workin' on the square now, maybe we could get some coffee in the morning, if you want.

Yeah. I know I did. But...  I'm tryin' to be dif'rent. I'm tryin' to... get some peace, you know?

I just wanted some make-up.

I just think you should'a kept him off me, that's all.

I'm sorry... I didn't mean to shout...

But... Momma... just tell me... not gonna be mad... we can just talk about it... Be eye to eye on this... You don't even got to say you're sorry... Just say how you knew...

You got any money?

I said we wasn't gonna talk about him.

Save that hustle talk to them field ballers you sell crack to.

Mobile technology is the new fix for these niggaz, I'm tellin' you. I'm just lookin' ahead.  Anyways, ain't no money in drugs no more with these rednecks popping cough pills like they's Skittles. Hey, that's what you need, girl. Get you some cough medicine. What, you sick?

Alright. How much you need, ho?

I think she got to you, pappy.

... It's not like you were slow or anything... I think you did just fine.  I think you did great.

Hey, hey, where you goin'?

He works for Frank Abolofia. Atlantic City.  Casinos.

What's this?

Back-up.

Why?

Nick, let's go hunting.  Bag Cavello.

... I found the goombah... Cavello. He's --

Whoa, I knew you were going to say that.  I absolutely anticipated that, Nick.  But I said to myself, Charlie, Charlie, we can move up on this, so go find Nicklaus... He'll be pissed for a moment, but then it'll dawn on him --

What are they doing now?

Charlie, don't do anything.  Promise me?

Frank Abolofia.

Some party.

... Nick, you're the one that's always saying you never go anywhere.

What are you missing?  Riding your motorcycle to the nurse's house. That shit is sadder than Ethiopia.

I call, right?  I say I got the dreaded thirty six-hour Asian shits from some raw clam and we stretch it into three days.  You and I become a driving force on the local Geisha scene.

What'd you say?

Nick... You up?

Nick, have I been a good partner?

I just want you to know... I mean anybody who says you ever took has got to deal with me.

I worked the three nine in Queens, Charlie.

Givin' you a book is like givin' a baby a gun.

... Detective Ich-iro Matsu-moto. Hey, we're getting Mr. Moto on our side.

This should be it...

This the right place?

Getting very weird.

It's incredible.  Hit him or something.

... He's a sorry old guy, but I like him.

Now that's the kind of motorcycle I want to see you on.

You cool, Ich?

What does Ichiro mean, anyway?

It's getting too cold even for me, Nick.

All right, how's the new partner?

You'll take care of that.

Where do we start looking for this guy?

Where're you going, Ichiro?

"Goodness, gracious, great balls of fire."  To the killer.  Jerry Lee Lewis.

No, this is the place for the young Yakuza.

... We got to keep looking.  Track him down!  Great balls of fire!

Nick!

It's Ichiro.  Ich.

You know, Inspector, you take shit once, you take shit forever.

Why the hell not?

What happened?

You must leave?

I've continued working on the case!

Know her?

Nick, no one's seen Kobo in three days.  He might not even be in Tokyo.

You said you could keep up with her! 'No problem, Nick-san.'

What'd I tell you?

You're doing fine, Ich.  Now drop it, okay?

Nick...

Work, lunch, groceries, laundry... Fabulous...

Chikuwa, Hampen, Kobu, Konnayaku, Ganmodoki --

Yakuza.

You can't come in.  They don't want --

If I smell one drop of Scotch on your breath, my friend --

I'm not drunk...

Nick --

... A Godfather.  His man was killed at the printing plant.

Ich, my name is Nick.  Not Nicklaus, not Nicklaus-san, not Nick-san. Nick.

Nick!

Where does this Sugai live?

I want to go talk to him.

Because he knows how to get to our man.

It's very small.

It's illegal, Nick.

What's in the box?

Nick, you can't do this.

Grab the keys, Ich, and get inside.

Start it.

Just one, compadre... Kampai.

You did great, Ichiro.

I was ready to have your ass for taking off on me.

How many men?

Joyce?

Someone attacked him.

Thank you.  You have one?

I'm sorry.

You know, Nick, we can't lose.

Think we'll get him, Nick?

Don't give him any more.

Ich said you left.

You can count on the truth from people who don't like you.

Look, you need Ich.  I've been here five years and I still can't read all the street signs.

Don't be an ass.

You know where I can get a decent cup of coffee this time of night? I'm buying.

I need your help, Joyce.

I've heard of Sugai.  I've also heard of the emperor.  They're both national treasures.  One's a hood.

And I'm supposed to care?

You're wrong to sell Ich short.

Where's the wife?

I'd invite you up but I know you'd hate the incense.  I chant.

I don't remember saying yes.

This little guy thinks you're Robert Redford... the other one thinks you're Charles Bronson...

We're in?

Bullshit, Nick.  And don't tell me this is all just about Charlie. It's not.

I still think you're a bastard.

Might be different in New York.

Keep the change.

Ugly... A couple of thousand years they've been bound by these little rules.  Looking in.  Always afraid. Ugly little lives...

She's such a long way home for you.

This is my stop.

Sugai won't give it to me, you know that.

How big a package we talking about?

Dope?

One guy do all the damage?

Doesn't speak a word of English. And he won't speak Japanese either. No papers.  The Japanese embassy is very interested.

He's wanted in Japan.  They want him first.  Then we can have him.

You and Charlie are taking the Jap home, tonight.

Check your gun before you leave. They're not allowed in Japan.  It's a nice, safe country.

It's not your job.

They're blaming it on you.  Christ, Conklin, you didn't even tell me you lost the prisoner!

How?  You don't know the place.  You don't know the language.  Get on the plane.

... Remember, counterfeiting is the Feds.  They'll be all over Abolofia's place.  Stick tight. You I.D. the other plate, he does real time.

We're police officers.

Hey, inspector, I don't intend to take the rap for this.

Could you fill me in?

Because I want you to tell me.

What's this?

While you were hanging out at the visa office, we found the son-of-a- bitch.

Your plane leaves at six.  Two officers will escort you.

You had my help, detective.

-- Do you know where she is, detective?  Do you know how to find her?  Even where to start?  We will find them.

Seven years work by the finest engraver.  Mass produced, sequentially numbered.  The best there has ever been, Mr. Conklin.

I took Kobo from the street.  I gave him a home, a future... But my ways were too slow for him... I served seven years in prison for my boss when I was a young man.  Kobo wouldn't serve seven minutes for his Oyabun.  He was supposed to take over this syndicate when I retired.

Our associates in New York were close to closing a deal with us.

Imagine if your families could pay their gambling and drug debts with perfect counterfeit bought for cents on the dollar.

Why tell me this?

You trust me?

With these?

If I say no?

Good.

That wasn't our deal.

Can't thank you enough, Mr. Sebastian. If you hadn't come along...

We're not used to the big city. Where we come from it's not so easy to get lost.

He knows what he's doing.

I'm sure glad you found us, Sebastian.  What do you think, Mary?

Let's go while there is still time.

What's the point?

One man.  He must be good.

The name is Batty.  Roy Batty.

Would you like to be modified?

I want more life, fucker.

The facts of life.  I'll be blunt. To make an alteration in the evolvement of an organic life system, at least by men, makers or not, it fatal.  A coding sequence can't be revised once it's established.

Because by the second day of incubation any cells that have undergone reversion mutation give rise to revertant colonies -- like rats leaving a sinking ship.  The ship sinks.

Then a repressor protein that blocks the operating cells.

But not to last.

Also you're too valuable to experiment with.

I've done some questionable things.

I like a man who stays put.  An admirable thing to be able to sustain yourself in these times. You live here all by yourself, do you?

Oh, no bother, I'd be glad to.

Why are you staring at us?

What, Sebastian?

What generation are you?

We have a lot in common.

Not only that, but we have smiliar problems.  Accelerated decrepitude. But we don't want to die quite yet.

You could help us.

He's not really my friend.  I just do a job for him now and then.

He could?

I'd be happy to mention it to him.

No.

Where are you going, Sebastian?

What's going on down there?

When?

This is my Uncle Roy, Sebastian.

Then we're stupid and we'll die.

Six, huh?

What was he after?

You got a machine on it yet?

The Tyrell Corporation has a demo model.  Check it out on the Voight-Kampff.  There's a chance the Nexus-6 is beyond out ability to detect.  If that's the case, everybody's up shit creek.

Yeah.

I didn't like her.

Yeah.

Take a number.  Canapt 1700, tenth floor, Villa Vita District, Olympia South.

If you don't, we will.  It has to be total, Deckard.  That's an order from as high as it comes.  Got it?

It's gotta be right for my customer.

Well, when do you get paid?

When might that be?

Machines can be helpful sometimes, but they can also be a pain in the ass.  Ask for a trace on a forger and you might wind up at a steel- mill.  I don't mind a bum-steer once in a while -- it's their personalities that usually get me.  Somebody once said that man makes machines in his own image.  If that's true, whoever made Esper should have been shot.

You equipped for random questions?

You start.

How do I stop one?

Okay, but...

Yes?

Not if it works.

I think I have no money.

But I would like to buy you drink.

Vodka!

Thank you very much.

Prosit.

You want to see my friends?

Those cockroaches?

How long you had these guys?

Prosit.

You like to kiss her goodbye.

I like you.

One more, eh?

I'm great.  I mean, I know I'm not really great, but I feel just great.  How you like my new suit?

Don't make me laugh.  It makes me pee.

Hey, it's okay.  I like to pee. So how are you doing?

Money?

What's that?

Love is just another name for sex. Love is sexy and sex is lovely -- I don't care what you call it, an android can't have it.

Nerves of steel.

I didn't say that.  Your motivity rate checked out a little slower than last time.

During the road test...

But you haven't put in for emigration.

You're going to be over the limit.

My job is here.

Taffey Lewis?

I'd like  you to take a look at these pictures.

You see I lost my contacts a couple of days ago around here somewhere and my sight is a little... What am I supposed to be looking for?

This one looks familiar, but I don't know.  Naw.  There's one came in today looks a little like this one but...

Nothing.  She wanted to know about suck night.

That's what we call in the trade, audition free-for- alls and most of it sucks. Bit I don't think that's her.

Book the good ones for where?

What shows?

Yeah?

There's been reports of management sexually abusing the artists in this place.

How do you mean 'exploited'?

What the fuck for?

It's a good job.

The best.

Jeezus!

Me.

It seems your department doesn't believe out new unit is to the public benefit.

It's artificial?

Are you apprehensive?

I wouldn't accept it.  Also, I'd report the person who gave it to me to the police.

In a magazine you come across a full-page photo of a nude girl.

In your opinion.

Is there anything else?

I've already got more help than I need.

There's two reasons a man rejects help.  Either because he's so good at what he does he doesn't think he needs it, or he's so insecure he can't admit it.

Two of us might be more effective than one.

You use your equipment, don't you?

Do I make you nervous?

They probably want to find out when they were made.

Don't just stand there looking at me.  It's not polite.

You ever take a bath with a man before?

Who is this?

Where is he?

How come you're not on the job?

How are you doing?

What do people do in the afternoon?

Did you cry when your father died?

I don't know, I have nothing to compare it to.  I guess I thought there was something more to it.

I don't know... I think I missed something.

When was the last time you cleaned this place?

Have you ever cleaned your apartment?

They could clean around the arrangement.

But if I don't plug it in how can I...

This feels stupid.

You're sick, Deckard.

Have you ever known anybody a long time?

Uh-huh.

Ten years.

Why do you call it retire, why don't you call it murder?

Don't you think anything that can suffer deserves to be considered?

Do you think I simulated what happened between us?

You know what I think?

Where the hell you been?

Next time you go on vacation, do me a favor, let us know where it is.

Bad?

Is this to be an empathy test?

May I ask a personal question?

Have you ever retired a human by mistake?

Like you said, Mr. Deckard, a machine can be a hazard.  The Voight-Kampff scale is a machine, isn't it?

Well?

How many questions did it take?

She didn't know?

How many questions does it usually take, Mr. Deckard?

You're not responding to the stimulus.  I can see right here, I'm not getting a reading.

I kinda get nervous when I take tests.

You're in a desert, walking along in the sand when all of a sudden you look down and see a...

What?

Doesn't make any difference what desert -- it's completely hypothetical.

Maybe you're fed up, maybe you want to be by yourself -- who knows.  So you look down and see a tortoise.  It's crawling towards you...

Know what a turtle is?

Whatcha mean, I'm not helping?

How come you were in my truck?

What's your name?

You want to go home?

Where are your folks?

What about friends?

We scared each other pretty good didn't we?

Whatcha doin'?

And you live in this building all by yourself?

Twenty.

Methuselah Syndrome.

My glands.  They grow old too fast.

Ah, you get hold of your friends?

Sebastian doesn't like to go out too much.

What makes you think so?

Hi!

Bravo!

This is my new friend...

We work on Rodeo Drive.  But we're both professional dancers.

Your mom was a dancer?

I'm Nina Aron, Adam.

Very well, thank you. I'm with the County Family Services Department. Eve tells me you've been living in a bomb shelter most of your life.

We want you to come with us so we can talk some more about your experiences.

My office.

Well, that depends...

Let's go talk first, Adam.

The key to my hotel room!  I want you to have my baseball cards!  And please be sure to pay my bill!

How do you do?

But I do miss that green sport coat of yours.

Please excuse this interruption.

I'm sorry, and legs. Legs, butt and hair.  Well, isn't he?  And shallow, as well?

Cliff, I must warn you. I know how to defend myself.

Maybe we shouldn't fight at all. Fighting is pretty immature.

Bon soir, mademoiselle!

Come on, Heathcliff, I'll walk you to the corner.

Where are we going?

No, I'm lost.

Say,...did you just lose your job because of me?

Dickhead?

I came on a bus.

So far?

Right.

Again.

It was amazing.

Do you own a car?

If it will make you feel any better, I don't have a gun.

I'm sorry!  I said something wrong, didn't I!  Please forgive me!

Wait! Please wait!  I'll make a deal with you!  I'll give you a Rogers Hornsby, if you'll take me to the hotel!

Rogers Hornsby's worth like four thousand dollars!

So for four thousand dollars, all I have to do is drive you to your hotel?

And that's it?

I don't have to take a physical in your space ship?

So...Mister Andretti, your first time on the freeway?

Wait!  Wait!

It's Perry!

Perry Como!  You had him!  Go back! Go back!

Over this?

Gee-zooie!!  You better slow down!!!

I am so glad to see you!!  I thought I'd never see you again!

I can't, it's yours.

Why are you doing that?

Wait, Eve, please!  Wait.

I knew this would happen!  You're like a lost puppy!

Troy? Is he your husband? Or a boyfriend?

Thank-Q!

I think it's the eyes.

Watching television in color.

See, ya.

...Okay.

Why not go to work for me?

Selling all my baseball cards. And helping me buy enough food and supplies to fill several large trucks.

Well, they're not starving yet, but they need help.

Who are these people?

Very funny, smart ass.

Wait! Wait!

Well, another day, another dollar.  Stop staring at me!!

Pick you up at eight tomorrow morning.

We'll have to rent a refrigerated truck for the beef and poultry.

Thank you.

There's something else I would like you to help me with.

Well, this is going to sound a little crazy.

Then forget it.

Well... Okay. I would like you to help me find a...wife.

Yes.

Because I want to get married.

I don't want to be alone.

It does?

I didn't know that.

They're all divorced?

One who's not a mutant.

Well, I could probably get you laid in two weeks, but to locate a non-mutant wife from Pasadena...that could take some time.

Could we talk about that a little later?

Get out!

Now, get out!!

Stop that ma'am crap!

You almost got us killed!

I was wrong!!

Actually,no. I was wondering why Cliff likes to wear another man's underpants.

Here you go.  One champagne cocktail.

I thought only hookers drank those things.

I'm seeing...snow... lots of snow. Way up North.  Are we getting hot?

You live in...Alaska.  The only way in or out of your place is by plane and... you've definitely come down here for food and supplies and... to find a wife!

Yeah, right!  That's where you'd go to find girls!  Nome.  He's gay, by the way.

Where's he gone?

He has a computer?

May I please be excused?

All right.

The what?

The guy with the underpants!

About clothing?

What about holding your right arm up like that all the time?

He's going to kill himself.  Go skate out on the bike path! It's that way!

Hey, Eve!

Yep.  You know, my father -- who is a scientist -- says that everything is a miracle. Everything. Until recently I wasn 't sure what he meant by that.

I certainly do!

No it's not!

Then just help me find a girlfriend! That's all I ask. I'll give you every single card I've got left!

Would you do it just because you're my friend? My very best friend.

My goodness gracious!  This place is something!

No!  Not crazy!

Quit showing off!  We're here on business!

I thought I was here to meet women.

I like her.

What have you ordered?

What about her?

Why?!  I think she's very attractive.

Yes, I have a dictionary. But I can't understand for the life of me why you would call her that!  Or why Cliff would say that about you.

Okay. I like that.

Really?

That's ridiculous.

What?

You wanted to see me!

Why are you suddenly so mad at me?

I've never lied to you.  I've maybe let you believe things that you wanted to believe, but I've never lied.

No.  I admire you.  I...I fell in love with you the first time I saw you.  I did. I think that you are the most--

I'm leaving, too.

Eve?!

I know...and I'm really sorry.

What?

Eve, if you'll let me, I can --

There.

I went to Sophie's and she was very hospitable.

But it just wasn't where I wanted to be so I left as politely as I could and found a taxi.  But I asked the driver to drop me here instead of at the hotel.  There's a song Mister Como sings called "On the Street Where You Live."  You know it?

Adam...dumb question, but humor me. Have you ever had sex before?

Uh-huh. Adam?

I want you to go back to the hotel now.  I'll call you a cab.

That's right.  And I'll see you in the morning in the lobby.  Do you mind waiting outside for the taxi?

My pleasure.

Really?  Okay!

Hi, Eve!

No.

We can make this work, Adam! Believe me! I'm very good at making things work!

Is that a birthday cake?!

Is this because of the radiation?

Good evening. I want to stay at this hotel.

A card?

Are you all right?

All in yellow?  Oh!  That was my father!

I know it has been terrible.  But it wasn't your fault. And now all the decay is over with and things are going to get better. You understand?

I've got to go, now.

That's always a good idea! Would you like some money? I have a great deal of it.

I've got almost everything we need! And this nice man...

This is what money looks like.  It comes like this, in coin, or like this in paper.  Or you can have an "investment."  These are stock "certificates" that we bought in your name.  Of course, they're worthless now, but at one time they were quite valuable.

Sure. Now, let's move on to our French exam.

You're right!  It's Tuesday already! By gosh, time flies, doesn't it?!

En arte voluptus. Que les bons temps roulÈ!

Sorgen sie bitte dafur das die gepack sorgfaltic behandeldt warren!

These are wonderful.

What's baseball?

Like one of Mom's?

The nocturnal flying mammal?

No, no! The runner on second goes to third! He's out there!

Because he's forced out at third! It's a force!

Thank you, Mom! Thanks, Dad!

Holy Cow! What the heck are these?!

Well, do we just go on up?!

Helen-Thomas-Webber!  Maybe we have been down here a little too long!  Please excuse her French.

Adam...don't forget...don't forget ...

...the pipe tobacco.

Also...stay out of the "Adult Bookstore."

Poison gas. Invisible. Don't forget.

One more thing. If you find a healthy young woman, bring her back with you.

But, I don't understand.

This is great son, just great. By the way, Eve's last name. Rus-to-kov, that's not Russian, is it?

Uh-huh.

You're sure?

That's what everybody believes?

What? Did the politburo just one day say - "We give up?"

My gosh, those Commies are brilliant! You've got to hand it to 'em!  "No, we didn't drop any bombs!  Oh yes, our evil empire has collapsed!  Poor, poor us!"  I bet they've even asked the West for aid!  Right?!

You have very nice ceilings.

Not particularly.

I love Lucy!

It's a very small place. People don't even know it's there.

Maybe Eve can guess.  She's psychic.

Right on the button.

That's right?

I've got goose-bumps all over me.

Well, we try. Listen, let me just ask you a few questions.  When did Alaska become a state?

Who use to own it?

When did we get it from them?

What's the capitol?

Hello! It's Anchorage!  Gotcha!

It's so small.

I don't think so.

No.

Mt. McKinley.  It's also the highest point in North America.

That would knock my father out.

Oh, yes.  It would probably kill him.

Yes. He likes windows.

...I guess it's...just a matter of personal taste.

Not on him.

Why not? He has great pants.

Isn't it a little tiring to sit up straight like that?

I guess a lot of those tall buildings we saw this morning are new.

That's why little things mean so much to him.

Why did you park way back there?

What?!

Yes! Lying is always a very effective dating tool.

No, I wouldn't go in one of those places with a gas mask on.

Does that work?

And thanks for always being happy!

You dial nine to get out.

The hotel.

Thank you. Your father is a smart guy.

No kiddin'. Well...good night.

You don't look thirty-five.

Twenty-five? Around there.

Up here on the fifteenth floor?

What?  What is it?!

The sky?  Where?

I don't see anything!

Help you?

Come on. Frozen. How much are they?

Then I'll need, twelve into nine hundred, seventy-five boxes. And that's almost...five hundred dollars just for the hamburger! And my Mom only gave me three thousand dollars for everything! The yacht batteries! The diesel oil! The birthday candles!

Sure.

Say what?!

I do alright.

Hello.

How--how much do you want for the Mickey Mantle, rookie season?

I didn't want to leave without saying how much I admire your jewelry.

Oh. A nice one, I hope.

Elbows, Son.

Dad!

He seems to be doing all right now.  I don't know if he's had a heart attack or just... a horrifying experience. But we  need supplies and I've got to stay with him.

I don't know how far you'll have to travel to find supplies, but if you can't get home by nightfall, I want you to look for something called a Holiday Inn. Write that down. It's a hotel. There might still be one standing.

Right.

Yes?

Oh, Adam,that would be wonderful if you could find a girl. One who's not a mutant...and hopefully comes from Pasadena. Nothing against Valley girls, but in my day anyhow, the girls from Pasadena, I don't know...always just seemed a little nicer.

Here's the shopping list and $3,000 which should take care of everything.

Your father has a few final words for you. You know, he'd fight a buzz saw for you - he loves you so much. We both do.

...and his church group have volunteered to help us bring the supplies down.  But we've got to hurry.

I think I'm being chased by a psychiatrist.

We have to go.

This is your bedroom?

Well, where are you --

No.

Oh, my God!

No!  Not the police!  Don't call them!

No, I can't have that! They'll come with their cars and their guns and their handcuffs--

I was frightened and I didn't know what to think! But you know-I believe him. I think he just wants to go home. Wherever the hell that is...

According to Caltech, this Webber guy was a bonafide genius and a borderline nutcase.

Unless we get a postcard or somethin', that's my guess.

All back East.

He drank it hot?

Good god.

You got a light, honey?

So...you...survived the blast, did you?

Yes, yes, the song.  So tell me...has it been...hell up here?

For Pete's sake, Calvin!  We've got guests!

Well, put it down and come in!

It's time.

It shuts off automatically.

No.  They all do.

You hear that?!

Calvin, I wish you would have at least let me do the dishes. It's not going to be that easy getting all that dried- on food off my nice plates.

Oh, much worse. But not as bad as that Mexican Jumping Bean dip. You remember that?

How long will we have to stay down here?

But, what if I go into labor? That could happen any time.

Now you listen to me Calvin Webber, when this baby comes, you're going to be out in the waiting room smoking yourself to death with all the other fathers.

What's that noise?

The locks?

Thirty -five years!

To go up.

Hi, honey! Feeling better?

We have to be strong, sweetheart. If not for ourselves, for the child.

Burnt to a crisp.  I've given you the most well-done cut.

Maybe I've just got the creeps.

No. No! Calvin, this is different! Believe me!

Uh, oh. Now it's time.

Is there a problem?

I've noticed.

Yes!

Calvin?!

Why?

Very nice. Unless it caved in, too.

Watch this!

Not bad for a three and a half year old! I'd like to see the public school system match that! I don't care how terrific it is!

Yes, you certainly will. And you'll find a nice girl and rebuild America. Just the way it used to be.

Hi, honey!

Calvin!

Get the presents and do the lights.

No kidding.  Who else would have done it?

What did you wish for, Adam?

Oh, that's just a bunch of baloney! We never believed that in my family!

One who doesn't glow in the dark.

Let's eat our cake.

If we still have one.

You know, when we do go up...I'm going to miss this old place. How 'bout you, hon?

In the generator room again?

Should we say a little prayer first?

Yes, yes it is!

I'm going to give it to you straight. There's no point in beating around the bush. There were survivors. Apparently, the fallout has created....a subspecies of mutants.

Others are...multi-sexual.  It seems...they can be both masculine and feminine...simultaneously.

Yes.

We stay down here.

Yes.

No, Calvin.  We're not going to make do.  Not me!  Not Adam.  We're going up no matter what!  We deserve it. Even if it's terrible!

I want him to at least see the sky!

And the ocean!  A mountain range!

He's smart.

And Lord we ask finally that you send an angel to look after and protect our beloved son, Adam.  Amen.

Well, that's...considerably shorter than before.  I was wondering, Calvin, why set the locks at all.  I mean the radiation is gone and...

Well, please excuse us!  We...we haven't entertained a guest in...um...

What are you bitching about now?

I forgot some of my stuff.

You came back for these?

So where is your roommate, the model?

Go home, Adam.  Go to your hotel.

Stop it, you two!

Eve!  This guy is un-be-liev-able!

So, Adam...where on earth are you from?

You're serious, aren't you?

It means that your taste in men's apparel is as bad as your taste in men.

I'm sorry. But if the shoe fits.

I see "elegant."

Alright, I will.

Well, what do you think?

How 'bout it, Eve? Can he skate around your block?

That water's freezing!

Just be yourself.

Are you kidding?!  You wouldn't even be a crumb on her table!  You don't see that?!

Go to the bathroom.

He go back to the hotel?

What's that mean?

What's it to you?!

Where are you going?

To bed?

In the first place, I don't fall in love with weirdos I've only known for four or five days.

And I don't fall in love with grown men who collect baseball cards!!

Or pee in their pants when they see the ocean!

Or have perfect table manners.

What?

Well, consider the source. I don't even know what a lady is.

So now I suppose he's trying to make those two dancers feel as comfortable as possible.

What?!!

What are you going to do? Go over to her place and kick in the door?

I don't think so.

Oh, no!

What do you want to do with it?

And if we can't find him?

Millions upon millions upon millions! The cards. The stock!  The clothes! The toothpaste!  The guy was on the level!  And you blew it!  A man walks into your life who is the kindest, most polite, honest, trustworthy, incredibly rich guy you have ever met in your life!! And what do you do?!

Yeah! That's thinking.

I don't know. I like to think so.

To get some frozen poultry.

We came back to the house!

No. No, wait a minute. We stopped at a porno store.

An adult bookstore. He was very excited about seeing it. You think home is under a dirty bookstore in the Valley?

Why would you put a fallout shelter under a porno shop?

Well, we've come a long way, haven't we?  I want to go home.

Adam!!

I'm going to need two more banana- splits and a cherry coke!

I can't tell the boys from the girls anymore!

I miss those nice flower-power kids. How 'bout you?

I'm selling this place.  I want out of this hell hole!

Buy it from me?

Wolf One -- say intentions.

Tower, say again!!

I'm marking the 180 radial for five and ejecting.

I sent a trunk home yesterday. This is all I have.

I think it's important not to get depressed. Depression is a terrible thing. They say it can bring on illness.

Jeffrey, you're not going down by Lincoln, are you?

Doctor Gynde, my whole family's sick. What's going on?

Will you tell Mom when she gets home from the hospital that I've gone to dinner at Sandy Williams' house?

Oh yeah? Have you seen any?

Well, I haven't seen any. I wouldn't worry about it. Look, I better go.

Frank. Come in.

Suave. Goddam are you suave, you fucker. You want some beer?

Shit Ben! How the shit are ya?

Fuckin' good, real fuckin' good. You know this little tid bit, Dorothy, and this thing, here,  is a neighbor. What the shit we're doin' with a neighbor, I don't know. Goddam!!!  This is the suavest guy I know. Look at you. You're one beautiful fucker, Ben. I love this jacket and that cigarette holder of yours. Shit, that is too fuckin' much. Where's those glasses. This beer's gonna get too warm. I can't stand fuckin' warm beer. It makes me puke.

To your health, Frank.

Frank, I have something for you. Excuse us everyone.

See you Tuesday, Frank.

Are you Detective Williams?

My name is Jeffrey Beaumont - I live near you. I believe you know my father, Tom Beaumont - Beaumont's Hardware Store?

He's alright, I guess. I hope. They're doing tests, that's why I'm home from school. I was over at the hospital this morning and I was going home and in the field behind our neighborhood. There behind Vista, I found an ear.

Yeah. I've got it here in this bag. I thought I should bring it to you.

By the way, Jeffrey, this story isn't going to the press and I'm going to ask you to consider all you've heard strictly confidential. Do not discuss this business with anyone, but me, or other police personnel. Got it?

Come into the study a minute.

Detective Williams here. Yeah. Tell him to go to Sergeant Milton. Yeah, copy.  Well, Jeffrey, you found something which is very interesting to us. Very interesting. I know you must be curious to know more.  But. I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you not only not to tell anyone about your find, but also not to ask more about the case. One day, when it's all sewed up, I'll let you know all the details. Right now, though, I can't.

I was the same way when I was your age. I guess that's what got me into this business.

These are beautiful. How's the case coming?

Anything you can tell me?

Is that why you say it's horrible?

Why do you do it?

What is this? What color is it?

What color is it?

Jeffrey! Come on in.

Well now Jeffrey, how did you come to get so involved?

Is Sandy part of this?

Who knows you have these?

You're all through with this now?

Detective Williams!! Detective Williams!!

Yes it's me!!! Frank is on his way up to Dorothy's apartment.  Oh no. Frank has a radio and is hearing everything we say!!  Detective Williams. Hurry. I'm in the apartment. Hurry. I'm hiding in the back bedroom.

Because of your information I alerted internal affairs to check out Detective Gordon. I had to keep on with him as if nothing was different. He slipped off on his own when he found out we were going to raid Frank's place.

Not yet.

Yes? What is it?

Oh God, that stuff stinks.

That oughta do it.

Jeffrey. Jeffrey what?

You tell me!! Let me see that wallet.  Jeffrey Beaumont. What're you doing in my apartment, Jeffrey Beaumont?

What? Are you kidding me? Who sent you here?

An experiment? Hey, I've seen you before.

Tell me what you saw tonight. TELL ME.

The phone. What did you hear on the phone. Tell me. Word for word.

That's right. That's what I said. You have a good memory. Then what?

THEN WHAT?

How many times have you sneaked into girls' apartments and watched them undress?

Do you like that?

Do you like talk like that?

Don't.  I don't like that. What do you want?

Sure I'm alright. 

Don?

Thank you. honey.

Do you like the way I feel?

Yes.

You can hit me, if you want to.

Do you like me?

Next Christmas. Is he Santa Claus who has left a present for Dorothy? What was it? An ear? Another ear?!!  What was it?

No.

No. What is happening?

Then don't talk about killing.

Don't say that.

Hi, can I come in?

Why are you here. Whatiya want?

I looked for you in my closet tonight.  It's crazy, I don't know where you came from, but I like you.

I liked being with you last night.

Nice guy. Who's he?

Oh God. Don!!! Why can't I just die.

I can't. I can't. You think you know so much.

Look.

Falling.

Who is Don?

I came back to help you. You said do I let girls sneak into my house. You know where I live. If you need to, come to where I live, OK?

No. I should go.

Come in.

It used to make me laugh, but.

Yes. Frank--

No. How could he? Don't go. You think I'm crazy, don't you? I want you to stay.  Don't hate me.

I'm not crazy.  I know the difference between right and wrong.

What do you want to do?

Do you want to do bad things?  Anything, anything.

I want you to hurt me.

You like to open me, don't you?

That wouldn't be too good, would it?

Okay. I know you've been scared. Now you want to scare someone.

Come on Dorothy.

Look, snap out of it, will ya?

Do you love me?

Wait a minute. Wait. Whatiya want? For cryin' out loud!

I love you Don with all my heart.

I didn't mean to hurt you.

There's no disease, I can tell you.

I'm glad you do.

Dorothy. No!

Yes.

I'll call you.

What?

Oh no.

Yeah, it's me.

Where have you been?  Oh God, they hurt him, Jeffrey. Jeffrey, Jeffrey, Jeffrey, hold me. HOLD ME. Oh God.

They hurt his head.

Hold me, Don.

Frank gone?

Bull.

He's comin' back? What for?

Yeah, maybe so. Frank's got me, and you and really it's all thanks to Don, isn't it. Remember that. Your husband was the one who started fucking my mind with drugs.

He's the reformed dealer though who wanted to turn himself in. He's the one that caused Frank to come and Frank's fucking us real good. I just feel so horny. I'm supposed to be here watching you why can't I be here fucking you. Listen. I know his cock's the size of a pin - let me give you the real thing. Let me wet my whistle, baby.

Hello, baby.

Hello, daddy.

MOMMY!

Who's this fuck?

Where are we going, Frank?

Yes, but.

Look at these. What are these?

Don't say PLEASE, Fuckhead. WHAT ARE THESE?

Frank, he didn't mean it. Leave him alone. Come on. He didn't mean it.

We're looking for him. In your opinion, why did Frank kidnap Dorothy's son and husband?

We're going to leave that up to Detective Williams. I'll tell you though, you're okay. You shot a real son of a bitch.

I don't want to go.

On a ride.

Heineken.

Hey neighbor. Here's to Ben.

What are you lookin' at?

Don't be a good neighbor to her or I'm gonna send you a love letter. Straight from my heart, fucker. You know what a love letter is? It's a bullet, straight from my gun, fucker. Once you get a love letter from me, you're fucked forever. Understand, Fuck?

Come on. I wancha to meet a frienda mine. Raymond, get enough beer for Ben too.

I mean, for good, Jeffrey.

Jeffrey, honey. Your father's condition is serious. It's going to cost so much. We just won't have the money to keep you in school. I'm telling you this now, so that you can get your things together and check out of school, honey, or whatever you have to do, it'll save you another trip back. You're going to have to work at the store.

What time are visiting hours?

Well. Okay.

Yeah?

What?

Thanks a lot, Mom.

I'm going out for awhile.

No, I'm just gonna walk around.

Nothing. I'm fine.

Hello, uh, my name is Jeffrey Beaumont. Is Detective Williams in?

I just wanted to ask him a few questions, that's all. Maybe I better go.

I was sorry to hear about your father. I know your mother from church. It's such a shame.

Would you like a piece of cake?

It's a real good chocolate cake. Duncan Hines' devil's food. Real good.

He comes over to study.

Mrs. Williams? Thanks for the cake.

Here you are. Would anyone like coffee?

Please excuse me a moment, Jeffrey, and I'll get to the dishes.

Sandy?... Sandy, please.

No.

Yeah, well I never wanted to get slaughtered much.

Hey, you ivy league shit. COME HERE!

Hi Dad.

Looks like they've got you strapped in pretty good.

Are you feeling okay?

Good to see you, son.

How ya doin' Dad?

Yeah, how did you know?

Yeah I did, treasurer. Shouldn't you be studying or something.

No. You're not bothering me. You a senior?

What else is new? Right?

I'm home from school. My father's in the hospital.

What do you know about the ear? Anything?

Come on, you brought it up. Do you know anything?

Do you know who was brought in for questioning?

Were all these people questioned this afternoon?

The ear is from a missing person maybe?

It's a strange world isn't it? Do you know what building the woman lives in?

I guess you have to get back home soon?

That's the building. She lives on the Seventh Floor. Don't stop to look long, the police are watching.

Oh yeah. What about those other people? Anything?

You really do hear a lot, don't you?

I have to help out in my father's hardware store. They're giving me sort of my own hours for a while, which is nice.

What happened to him?

I've gotta go in.

I guess I'll see you sometime.

You hungry or thirsty, or both?

I'd like to talk to you about something.

I don't want to cause any trouble.

I guess Mike's got some sort of sports practice in the afternoon.

Alright, now tell me. What is it?

It wouldn't hurt to hear the plan, I guess.

Now, how are you going to do that?

What will I say when she comes to the door?

I don't know, it sounds like a good daydream, but actually doing it is too weird. Too dangerous.

Now, we'll walk over so there's no license plates and you give me at least three minutes. I can stall if it's more, but I need time to find a good window, alright?

Okay, I'm going ahead. Wait a minute, what's her name?

Are you alright?

I was just about to go to the door, when that man did my job for me. Was it alright?

Yeah, if it opens the door.

So, what's next?

I owe you, since I goofed up this one.

You really want to do this, don't you?

I'll tell Mike I'm sick. There's a game tonight anyway and he'll never miss me. Afterwards he can go out with the guys. Just so the record is kept straight though, I love Mike. What do want me to do?

I already know. The "Slow Club". It's on Route 7.

Yeah, but don't pick me up. My father may think it's strange. I'll walk over to your house. I'll be there at eight o'clock.

What's the plan.

Brilliant.

Jeffrey, I don't think you ought to do it.

It's crazy and dangerous. My God, I shouldn't have told you.

Yeah, but.

OK.

I, I don't want to see you tomorrow. Mike's coming over.

Call tomorrow. It's okay. Good luck. I hope you can sneak out okay. You're going to wait until she's asleep?

I'm going to wait here until she comes.

Okay, thanks.

That's for me to know and for you to find out. I'll see you. I mean call you, okay?

Well, how did it go? What happened?

What did you see?

What's with Mike?

You want a Dairy Queen?

You want to tell me about it?

Wow. Should you tell my father?

You saw a lot in one night.

Twice. Without her sensing anything?

Did you see her undressed?

Yeah?

Who, me? Why should it?

You're sure right. It is a strange world.

Okay, be careful.

Can I give you a kiss good night?

Okay, okay.

You were late.

What am I going to do?

You know, that cheese is practically all chemicals.

Shoot.

Nothing really, but it's interesting. They know each other. They seem to like each other.

Oh yeah?

Jeffrey!!

I can't believe what you are finding out. Are you going to continue with this. Are you going back to her apartment?

You like mysteries that much?

You worry about me really?

Great. Hey, I've got a bit of a problem. I know some things that could help your father but you might get into trouble.

Everything okay?

You didn't tell him about me?

I should never had gotten you going on this.  Yes Jeffrey. Friday's on!

Okay.

It's good to see you.

Just go over to Gelford and up to Vista. It's not far. Can you tell me any more about what you learned?

Thank you. Whatiya say we just enjoy the evening?

You want to dance?

Oh my God. What's wrong?

Dorothy!... Dorothy!

Take her to my house. My dad can get an ambulance faster than anyone. Do you have anything to put around her?

Probably not. No. Why?

Jeffrey? What's going on?

I should go with her, Sandy.

Please get to your father and send him and the police to Dorothy's apartment right away. Be sure your father comes. Something is happening over there. They're hurting someone, the guy she loves. Tell them to hurry. I'm going over right now.

Look Jeffrey.

What are watchin' this junk for?

I don't know why we have to watch TV.

Come on out a minute, okay?

Hey come here, you stole my girl, you bastard. I'm gonna kick your ass, right in front of your stupid house.

What did he bring him in for?

Just for him?

Up where?

Hey, I just...

I need Il Duce.

Well listen, I know how my boys take ta scrappin' when they take ta drinkin'.

Are ya ready?

Yes sir.

Paraffin came up positive. And bullet holes are usually a big clue.

Look under the body.

Are these me considered armed and dangerous?

Look, look! I'm not saying one way or the other. Just be careful and go by the protocol on this one.

The press is everywhere outside. They're going nuts for these guys. What do you want to do?

Poppa Joe said there was only two. In and out.  Boy, you guys sure did a good job. You're good, huh? Cool masks. Where'd you get them?

What did you do?! Fuckin'... what the fuckin' fuck! Who the fuck, fucked this fuckin'? fuck. How did you two fuckin', fucks?......... FUCK!!!

What the fuck are you doing here? What, huh!? WHAT? WHAT? WHAT? ANSWERS! I WANT FUCKIN' ANSWERS!

Anybody you think is evil?

Climb the corporate ladder, boy. Don Rocco.

Donna's gonna be angry about her cat.

She ain't been around in weeks anyhow.

What?

What are you saying?

You think they sold me out? No way.

No, no. That's just not the way things are done. Besides, how's he know I don't just get in there see there's too many and just serve em their fuckin' food and beat it?

No. No man. That's... that's... you don't know what you're talking about. That's bullshit. I know these guys. I mean, thanks for your concern, but that just ain't the thing of it.

What did I fuckin' do?... in the middle of the Lakeview.

Anybody see ya?

What? What is it?

Oh man. You gotta let me do these guys. I'm such a moron. I gotta make up for the tit thing.

You guys gotta teach me that prayer, man. That's some good shit.

Who the fuck was he, Rocco? I know you fuckin' know!

Look again for fuck sake!

They got nothing.

You little fuck. Let him go. I'll drop you right here.

Let him go or I will deliver you, right now. 

You guys?

Hello.

It's all your fault. Both you little bastards. I was a fool to believe you would bring me any peace. The day your Da left us when you were almost too young to remember, he said the two of you would do me right and make me proud, but he was wrong and I got nothin' ta live for.

What?! What are you doin'?

No ma! No!

How's Uncle Sibeal?

Well, we tried ta make friends and she gave me a shot ta the nuts.

Yeah, we promise.

Still bickerin' over that, huh?

You guys are not under oath, here. I am assuming you knew these two guys from before, huh?

Well, the light caught the side of his face for a second. And it looked like he had a gray beard, maybe... late fifties, early sixties.

We're going to hit Poppa Joe tonight, right in the comfort of his own home. Then we move on to New York. It's getting a bit hot for us here.

We're alive.

Would someone please come over here and...

me up the...

Hey Murphy?

How many feminists does it take to screw in a light bulb?

No fuckin' hot water man. That...

Aaaww, shit!... evil woman!

Oh, Jesus.

Don't even do it, ya bastard.

A p-penny saved is worth two in the bush.

Listen fellas, Y'know he's got 'til this week's end. Ya don't have ta be hard asses, do ya?

"Now, that wasn't too polite, was it?"

How do you think he figured all this out without talking to us?

I have no idea. Maybe someone saw and talked.

Absolutely not.

Destroy all that which is evil...

Know what we need, man?... some rope.

Charlie Bronson's always got rope.

Yeah, these guys always got a lot of rope strapped around em in the movies and they always end up using it.

I'm serious.

I don't know they just always need it.

Is that right, Rambo?

See. I told you there'd be a shaft.

Where the fuck are you going?

We're doing some serious shit here. Now, get a hold of yourself, asshole.

That was way easier than I thought.

On TV ya always get that asshole that jumps behind the couch.

Oh, we're good man.

Where are you goin'?  Did you tell him?

Who did you kill?

So what do you think?

We've teamed up with a sex offender.

Give the guy a shot.

There he goes.  Okay, gentlemen. Are we ready to bring this man into the light? Are we ready to truly do the work of the Lord?

That's the guy that got us off the hook with the "Checkov" thing.

He isn't to be touched.

It is your evil, who will be sought by us.

Each day we will spill their blood till it rains down from the skies.

These are not polite suggestions. They are codes of behavior and those that ignore them will pay the dearest cost. 

For if you do, there will come the day when you look behind you and see we three. And on that day you will reap it.

I prefer to be called Rozengurtle by men.

Okay, just cut off as much fat as you can as it goes by and the rule of thumb here is...

Yeah?

I knew you two pricks would give me problems. Give me shit cause I'm a woman. I'm not gonna take your male dominance bullshit!

Baumgartner sound Irish to you, fuck face?

Holy shit. You're the first one that's ever got that.

And number three, Dolly.

So, what do we do now?

She was in here when it went down.

Only two did the shooting.  So what are you thinking, Russian retaliation?

Maybe the three of them had something in common.

And it's the same story over here. Why the crossover?  Theories.

No! Fuck you! You start getting excited! We gotta fucking go!

What?

I killed your fuckin' cat, you druggie bitch!

I felt it would bring closure to our relationship!

Your what?! Your fuckin' what?!

Your what, bitch? I'll shoot myself in the head, you can tell me that cats name! Go ahead... Your what? Your precious little... 

Peeperman? WRONG? What color was it?!!!

So what are you thinkin' here?

So Duffy, got any theories to go with that... tie.

The what man?

Well, Freud was right. So you think they came for the fag man, huh? And what do you base this upon?

The Greeks. The Italians.

The two bullets went in here, through the top of the skull, criss-crossed and exited through the eyeballs. This one clue tells us three distinct facts. Number one... Duffy.

Now stay with me, boys. What did they do to make two such identical wounds? Did one guy put him on his knees, pop a cap in, sit him back up and shoot him again the same way? No. Two men of similar height dropped this guy down, each put some iron to his head and boom! That's all she fuckin' wrote!

Now, what is this going to look like to those who do not know what I just told you?

Jesus. I just can't think anymore. That scene over at the coffee shop today tapped me out.

A guy went nuts over off of Commonwealth today. Shot three guys to death in a coffee shop in broad daylight. Fled the scene. Don't have much on him.

These two fucking scenes are related. Too many coincidences. Same day? Five hours apart? Dead mobsters on both scenes. Now, why did he kill the bartender?

Duffy. This look like a fucking post office to you? This guy came in here with intent. Maybe he didn't know exactly what he was gonna do but he had a pretty good idea. The bartender wasn't a fucking accident.

That's one big fuckin' shoe!... and think about it. Of all the ways to kill a guy, crushin' him to death. That's very particular. You don't get many of those. I dunno. I feel something big here. I wouldn't be surprised if we see more of these turning up.

Chief, what the fuck is this?

He's struck again, hasn't he, Greenly?

How many bodies, Greenly?

While Greenly's getting coffee, anybody else want anything?

Uh.  Shit, I, uh...

After talking to the dancer we know that their mark was the guy in the middle booth. After she watches them whack him, she passes out.  Why the two extra victims?

They weren't related. The guy used a 38. No pennies. Totally amateur.

What the...?

Oh my god!

It's only 11:00 here boys so I got lot's more drinkin' ta do with your worthless relatives down at the Anvil.

But he's been havin' himself a nip or two as well... Been up the waitress' skirt all night, poor girl.

Well fuck, you guys could do this every day.

You fuckin' guys. You ruined me. I'm fuckin' done. Permanent package boy.

Fuck you!

Fuck it! What kind of flowers ya want at your funeral? Ya dumb Wop. This is the last time I'll see you. Bye-bye ya stupid son of a bitch.

No. You sure you're okay?

Hello?

Hurry the fuck up!

Liberating isn't it?

Vincenzo, that fat motherfucker, Yakavetta's right hand. He's the one who set me up. Then he went around shooting his mouth off, telling everyone I was as good as dead. He goes in there every Wednesday night around 10:00, he jerks off in the same booth to the same titty dancer. Never misses.

Well, truth be known, those first ones just kinda fell into our laps.

You look like Mush Mouth from Fat Albert.

Well he sure as fuck knew you!

Hey! We gotta talk about this early morning church shit.

Hello? You there?

What is it my son?

Yes.

Has he now?

I guess not.

I believe these young men are right.

Yes.

The laws of God are higher than the laws of man.

Forgive me father.

You gonna do what I say, got it?

I'm sorry you're gonna hafta see this. Don't look at me!

Have you no fear of God?

Father, I'll do you right here.

Do your thing Father. Don't fuck this up.

Just be natural, goddamit.

I wouldn't have, uh, killed you, Father.  Dominus Ominus. Remember, you're bound. You can't talk about this... to anyone.

I always see you talking to the boys and making them laugh. They always come around telling me what a crack up you are. What is it they call you?

The funny man. Well, I got a new job for you, just for now. Roc, I'm having a real shitty day. I'm depressed. Tell me a funny story or a joke.

He's a nigger.

Continue the joke.

Well, it's the funny man. Give it here, package boy.

I'm Rocco. I'm the funny man. Heee Hee. I'm so fuckin' funny. Hee Hee.

Tell me a joke funny man. Hee Hee.

What color hair does he have?

Making Hutch David Soul?

I think you might of dreamed this one, Anthony.

Why?

See, that's what I'm saying. It has the logic of a dream.

What does Starsky say?

Did you see what I meant about the window?

She's really kind of hot.

It's got a V-8, Dignan.

Anthony, we'll get two hundred for the coin collection alone. That's less than what it's appraised at.

The list, Dignan. I know you remember the list because you signed it. "Things Dignan was not supposed to touch."

That doesn't make any difference. I bought those earrings for my mother on her birthday. They have a very special value for her.

Where are you going?

Did you see that?

I'm lookout.

I don't think so. Just reach on in.

It had an alarm.

Holy shit. What'd I tell you?

But he didn't say anything.

Loop around real fast.

Now. One thing we need to discuss is timing. Timing is absolutely crucial. What are you doing? Anthony!

Anthony, give me the fucking gun!

Dignan, calm down.

Calm down. Take a deep breath.

There's another stocker, right?

Is that the manager?

What about what that guy said?

I swear to God. In a very quiet voice.

What's wrong with him?

Anthony, he sat in the car and watched a 4-11 in progress. He got what he deserved.

I didn't realize you were so sensitive to Bob's feelings. Considering I did the plans, you're actually lucky you got --

Why not?

She's not going to notice, Anthony.

Well, then cut it in half.

Yes, they are.

What about them?

Really. OK, Dad. But seriously, Anthony. These are fast shoes.

That's real cool, Anthony. Yeah, I wore boots. My parents wouldn't buy me any $200 running shoes like yours. I wasn't spoiled.

OK. Go ahead.

Look, man. She didn't know anything about shirts.

Armored trucks are very difficult to steal, Anthony.

Right. Get back to me on that one. Once your plan is worth a shit.

Actually. If you knew the exact route, you could plant explosives under a manhole cover and blow it up as it went over.

Dignan, I can't get my hair cut. That's just not possible, all right?

No, Dignan. I'm sorry. I can't do that.

I thought you guys went to get your hair cut.

This is Inez. Carmen. Anita.

Inez, this is --

May I have a word with you, please?

What the fuck is going on here?

Anthony, we're on the run from the law here. Did you tell these people your real name?

They don't?

Which one was that?

She's from Cuba.

He needs to hire an attorney.

Now that makes sense. We'll hang out for a couple of days. Get a little R&R. Make sure Future Man's OK and then get back on the road.

Obviously. That's a given.

See, one day we were playing hot box over at my next door neighbor Mr. Langston's house and Anthony fell in the pool and got knocked unconscious. I had to dive in and save him.

Mr. Langston performed cardiopulmonary recitation. CPR. I've never said this before, but frankly I thought Anthony was dead. The veins in his face were all sticking out. His skin was blue. He truly did look dead.

But if it wasn't for Dignan I probably would of died.

He's gone. He stole the car.

He went back for his brother.

When'd he tell you?

Where was I?

He told you and you let him do it.

So when you were saying Bob's at the store and acting real surprised, that was just an act. You were just --

I understand that if I had a few more friends like you and Bob I'd be dead.

If you'd gone with Bob you'd probably be in Weatherford by now. Of course I'd be here frantically worrying thinking you must of got kidnapped.

We're going over to this bar if you feel like going.

Why don't you come with us.

I can't believe he just jumped you.

Man. I'm sorry. We just went for a walk --

I know we can. It's real simple. We go into a room, grab some car keys and --

She doesn't need to know.

Look. I'm ready to get the fuck out of here. It's real torture for me to be here. Getting the shit kicked out of me by Mexicans.

No one to back me up. Now I have a good idea. So unless you come up with something better --

Yes, I do. Bob taught me.

I think we better go home.

I'm not. But there's --

Our money situation is not good.

We've got sixteen dollars.

Sixteen dollars.

I had to give some to Inez.

You're in love with the fucking housekeeper!

When'd you get back?

Applejack would of got him anyway. This was just the quicker way.

Mr. Henry has an inside source. We call him Steve. That's where we get our information.

What time did he say to be here?

You could give somebody a concussion.

What do you think?

He doesn't want to fight.

No fighting. It wasn't Bob's fault.

Shit, Dignan.

I don't know, Dignan. You went crazy.

OK. Mark that down.

God. Isn't this great? Working on the job. Got a wheel man. Got a safecracker. Good friends with Mr. Henry.

Next week we'll be drinking piña coladas.

Or I might end up with a broken nose.

I'll try not to hold you back tomorrow.

I don't want to be too much of a liability.

He was a nice guy.

Do you like Inez?

Yeah. As a girl.

Bird Dog to Scarecrow. Bird Dog to Scarecrow.

We all set?

Uh-huh?

I'm in position, Scarecrow.

I've got a great view up here. I can see all the --

I don't know.

Freeze!

Help me move him.

Who tripped the alarm?

Where's Kumar?

What are you doing?

Wait for Kumar.

Come on.

What?

What are you talking about?

There's not enough time.

Dignan, it's too late.

Like amnesia.

So is Mr. Henry going to come by and see me or anything?

He did?

You got to be kidding me.

What'd he get?

You think Applejack knew?

Why?

Mr. Henry never gave you a test, did he?

You're living on a sailboat?

Where?

Does it float?

So how is it in there? 

I think I may have found a way out of here.

No. I'm not.

Shhh. Wait for my instructions.

When we go through the next gate you'll have 30 seconds to take out the tower guard.

Have the car running at the north- west checkpoint. Bob and I'll --

This is my business manager, Rowboat.

That's a sharp jacket.

It's hard to get much spin with this kind of paddle.

Every once in a while some cat comes to me. He wants to know how I made it. How did I become a success?  The first thing I tell them is: follow your instincts. Let your instincts guide you. The second thing I tell them is, for Christ's sake: you got to know your grammar.

You mean like techniques?

Look at that woman. She's what? Fifty? Fifty-five? But she hasn't let herself go. I appreciate an older woman who has a commitment to her body.

I guess what I'm trying to say is what the hell kind of person is this Dignan?

Sure, sure. He's a great person, and I'd call bullshit on anybody who said differently. But I wonder if the kid has the goods  up here.

That was a test?

How does that feel?

Did Dignan take the test?

Well, he agreed 100% that Bob should be dropped. And he also agreed you were a liability. But he felt his talent would make up for your weaknesses.

I'll tell you, Anthony. Times like this I get philosophical. What does it mean? What's it all about? Are you afraid to die?

No, that door over there.

Are you afraid?

Exactly. Woah.

Bob. Bob. That's a palindrome.  I love palindromes.

This is good.

But you're thieves. It's what you are.

We're renegades from despair.

Absolutely.

Future Man.

What do herbs have to do with it? I don't understand the --

Hector woudn't do anything.

Let them fight.

Are you serious?

See you.

What the fuck is Dignan doing with that cop? He loves them.

Oh, yeah. They'll never catch the guy.

Where you going?

Will you guys shut up? God. It's like having two little kids in the car.

You think he got my license plates?

Anthony, I --

What?

Bob, where you going?

Why not?

You've only been playing for two weeks, Bob. It takes a long time to learn this game.

I know it must of been a bad experience. But it doesn't sound like it was your fault.

I thought he didn't have to pay anything because of the technicality.

Were you adopted, Bob?

Well, because you guys don't look alike.

Was Future Man adopted?

Let's not even talk about it.

Yeah. Let's keep it --

You OK, Bob?

No, I know. I'm just saying. I feel fine. You want a piece of cake?

What are you doing?

Yeah.

We think Mr. Henry maybe --

How do you say nineteen?

Are you ever scared of finding a dead body in one of these rooms?

Were you born in Mexico?

Does my skin feel soft, Anthony?

Nice to meet you, Applejack.

Yeah.

Did you ever hear of the S. Cooper Trust robbery?

S. Cooper Trust, in San Francisco?

Let's go, Abdul-Shabazz.

There's a lot of valuable shit in there, Applejack. The silver and the china. The crystal. And the grandfather clock. Goddammit, I bet that clock's worth ten grand.

Just settling an old score. You might say revenge.

Is that him?

Yeah.

You don't celebrate til it's over.

What?

Are you a fag?

Dignan and Anthony, this is Little Richard. He's crazy. Totally nuts.

Little Richard. Trust me. You're insane. Jesus, this guy used to carry a percussion bomb around in his trunk. You do not want a guy like that loose on the streets.

Well, what do you think?

I'm not allowed to drive those.

No.

They are.

If you're that worried, maybe we should just steal one.

You stole a Trans-Am.

OK, Bob.

Well. What do you want to do? You want to steal one or just drive your car?

How much could you grow? Realistically.

Six thousand dollars? Come on, Bob.

Don't you guys tell anybody about my plants.
