Well, I thought we'd start with pronunciation, if that's okay with you.

Okay... then how 'bout we try out some French cuisine.  Saturday?  Night?

Forget it.

Cameron.

Seems like she could get a date easy enough...

Unsolved mystery.  She used to be really popular when she started high school, then it was just like she got sick of it or something.

Let me see what I can do.

Right.  See?  You're ready for the quiz.

That's because it's such a nice one.

Where?

I counted on you to help my cause. You and that thug are obviously failing. Aren't we ever going on our date?

Eber's Deep Conditioner every two days. And I never, ever use a blowdryer without the diffuser attachment.

Lesbian?  No. I found a picture of Jared Leto in one of her drawers, so I'm pretty sure she's not harboring same-sex tendencies.

Looks like things worked out tonight, huh?

Tons

Then that's all you had to say.

You always been this selfish?

No...

What crap?

Thank God!  If I had to hear one more story about your coiffure...

Like my fear of wearing pastels?

No

I hope so.

They do not!

No.

Who?

Would you mind getting me a drink, Cameron?

Is he oily or dry?

Sometimes I wonder if the guys we're supposed to want to go out with are the ones we actually want to go out with, you know?

I don't have to be home 'til two.

I did.

Hopefully.

Queen Harry?

My agent says I've got a good shot at being the Prada guy next year.

Hi, Joey.

You know the deal.  I can ' t go if Kat doesn't go --

Nowhere... Hi, Daddy.

Can you at least start wearing a bra?

It means that Gigglepuss is playing at Club Skunk and we're going.

What do you think?

What's normal?

At least I'm not a clouted fen- sucked hedge-pig.

It's Shakespeare.  Maybe you've heard of him?

Can we go now?

I really don't think I need any social advice from you right now.

You're welcome.

Like you care.

I wish I had that luxury. I'm the only sophomore that got asked to the prom and I can't go, because you won ' t.

What?

Why?

But you hate Joey

As in...

You did what?

After that, I swore I'd never do anything just because "everyone else" was doing it.  And I haven't since. Except for Bogey's party, and my stunning gastro-intestinal display --

I wanted to let you make up your own mind about him.

I'm not stupid enough to repeat your mistakes.

God, you're just like him! Just keep me locked away in the dark, so I can't experience anything for myself

I guess I'll never know, will I?

So did you

You set me up.

What? To completely damage me?  To send me to therapy forever? What?

Perm?

No! You're not dating until your sister starts dating.  End of discussion.

Then neither will you.  And I'll get to sleep at night.

Exactly my point

And where're you going?

Otherwise known as an orgy?

If Kat's not going, you're not going.

It's just a party. Daddy.

Daddy, no!

Why?

I have a date, Daddy.  And he ' s not a captain of oppression like some men we know.

Didn't have you pegged for a Gigglepuss fan.  Aren't they a little too pre-teen belly-button ring for you?

Just sent 'em through.

So they tell me...

North, actually.  How'd you   ?

Yeah.  A couple.  We're outnumbered by the cows, though.

Thirty-two.

How many people go here?

You burn, you pine, you perish?

I could start with your haircut, but it doesn't matter.  She's not allowed to date until her older sister does.  And that's an impossibility.

Because they're bred to.  Their mothers liked guys like that, and their grandmothers before them. Their gene pool is rarely diluted.

Joey Dorsey?  Perma-shit-grin.  I wish I could say he's a moron, but he's number twelve in the class.  And a model.  Mostly regional stuff, but he's rumored to have a big tube sock ad coming out.

Sure do ... my Mom's from Canada

You mean I'd get a chance to talk to her?

That's her?  Bianca's sister?

You wanna go out with him?

He seems like he thrives on danger

They always let felons sit in on Honors Biology?

Forget his reputation.  Do you think we've got a plan or not?

That's what I just said

I thought you hated those people.

Like we had a choice?  Besides -- when you let the enemy think he's orchestrating the battle, you're in a position of power. We let him pretend he's calling the shots, and while he's busy setting up the plan, you have time to woo Bianca.

In that case, we'll need to make it a school-wide blow out.

It's a lung cancer issue

Dead at forty-one.

Okay!  I wasn't sure

No, I ' m not.

Best case scenario, you're back on the payroll for awhile.

So what does that give me?  I'm supposed to buy her some noodles and a book and sit around listening to chicks who can't play their instruments?

Don't make me do it, man

It's off. The whole thing.

She's partial to Joey, not me

I don ' t know.  I decided not to nail her when she was too drunk to remember it.

She just needs time to cool off I'll give it a day.

She kissed me.

You get the girl.

Yeah, and I noticed the only part of you featured in your big Kmart spread was your elbow.  Tough break.

Not at all

Away.

And why would I do that?

What do you think?

Yeah, whatever.  I want you to go out with her.

You just said

But you'd go out with her if you had the cake?

You're gonna pay me to take out some girl?

How much?

Fine, thirty.

Fifty, and you've got your man.

I'm on it

I got her under control. She just acts crazed in public to keep up the image.

What?

A deal's a deal.

Do what?

Enough with the Barbie n' Ken shit. I know.

Are you lost?

We don't chat.

We're not.

Uh,  yeah.  We're old friend*

Hey -- it's all for the higher good right?

Patrick Verona   Random skid.

I'm sure he's completely incapable of doing anything that interesting.

Block E?

Just a little.

An attempted slit.

But imagine the things he'd say during sex.

William would never have gone to a state school.

That's never been proven

Does it matter?

No fear.

Who cares?

I didn't have a choice.

I did Bianca a favor and it backfired.

I got drunk.  I puked.  I got rejected. It was big fun.

Well, I guess we're not, since we don't have dates .

Okay, okay, we won't go.  It's not like I have a dress anyway

Oh, good.  Something new and different for us.

Who?

Sweating like a pig, actually.  And yourself?

My mission in life.

Oh, right.  Friday.

Like where?  The 7-Eleven on Burnside? Do you even know my name, screwboy?

I was in the laundromat. I saw your car. Thought I'd say hi.

Depends on the topic. My fenders don't really whip me into a verbal frenzy.



You know who The Raincoats are?

"I'm getting trashed, man." Isn't that what you're supposed to do at a party?

Funny, you're the only one

I'm fine. I'm

I just need to lie down for awhile

I know, just let me sleep

Leave it to you to use big words when you're shitfaced.

I told you

Sure, I do

Because then I'd have to start taking out girls who like me.

See that?  Who needs affection when I've got blind hatred?

Who?

I hate him.

You know what they say

What?

But it's Gigglepuss - I know you like them.  I saw you there.

Busy

Maybe.

Then why'd you ask?

Do what?

My father wouldn't approve of that that

He just wants me to be someone I'm not.

What are you doing here?

You 're so --

Don't for one minute think that you had any effect whatsoever on my panties.

Look up, sunshine

C'mon.  It's not that bad

Forget it.  I'm stayin'.

Maybe.

I figured it had to be something ridiculous to win your respect.  And piss you off.

So how'd you get Chapin to look the other way?

Acting the way we do.

I don't like to do what people expect. Then they expect it all the time and they get disappointed when you change.

Something like that

How?

Fallacy.

Hearsay.

I hate peas.

You're sweet.  And sexy.  And completely hot for me.

Go to the prom with me

You know what I mean

No what?

Why not?

So I have to have a motive to be with you?

Nothing!  There's nothing in it for me. Just the pleasure of your company.

It's Scurvy's.  His date got convicted. Where'd you get the dress?

Oh huh

It gets worse -- you still have your freshman yearbook?

Really?  What was it like?  A down payment now, then a bonus for sleeping with me?

I thought you could use it. When you start your band.

Because I like to torture you.

Don ' t you even dare. . .

I thought we decided you were going to school here.  At U of 0.

Enough!

Then tell them I had a seizure.

I thought you were punishing me.

Because you're making decisions for me.

No, Daddy.

I still maintain that he kicked himself in the balls.  I was merely a spectator.

No ... I believe "heinous bitch" is the term used most often.

Hi.

Yeah.  I guess.

Oh yeah.

Right.

Yeah...

What?

The situation is, my man Cameron here has a major jones for Bianca Stratford.

Dorsey can plow whoever he wants. I'm just in this for the cash.

So Dorsey can get the girl?

We're your guys.

Good enough.

Just for now.

Yeah.

No - I've got a sweet-payin' job that I'm about to lose.

Sweet love, renew thy force!

With the teeth of your zipper?

Touch of the flu.

Well, you know -- there's the prestige of the job title... and the benefits package is pretty good...

See you next week!

Make anyone cry today?

Sarah Lawrence is on the other side of the country.

Tumescent!

Pirate -- no question.

Kissing?  Is that what you think happens?  Kissing isn't what keeps me up to my elbows in placenta all day.

Dr. Ruth?

But -- who -- what --?

Your daughters went to the prom.

Absolutely not.

The water's going putrid in the barrels.

Ah, leave him alone.  He's doing no harm.

We'll all go crazy...

We left three weeks ago, Alonso. Can't be that near.

Yes, your Eminence.  The voyage should not take more than six or seven weeks.

Excellency, you are right.

Your life, and that of others!

Is that all that interests you? Gold?

Did He not choose a carpenter's son to reveal Himself to the world?

Blind faith is what I consider heresy!

IF-GOD-WILLS-IT!

The Judgment is ours!

Indeed.  The world is full of mercenaries -- and states often make use of them, when it benefits them.  My only concern is the welfare and prosperity of Spain.

On the contrary, Your Eminence.  It seems to me the man is preparing his own cross.

What a tragedy... what a waste of a life...

I know.

Well... that's true.  I have a child by a man who won't marry me!  Who's always leaving...

I'd love to argue with you sometimes.  But you're never here!

I find that hard to believe.

I don't want you to wait for me.

You don't usually ask.

They tried... but I didn't let them.

Not everything... Do you think I care?  I'm a free man again.  Riches don't make a man rich, they only make him busier...

I am busy inside.

I can't keep my eyes off you.  I would like to catch up with all the moments I didn't spend with you.

Bartolome and Giacomo Colon.

Yes... I remember...

Appointment to what?

Congratulations.  Then I am free to search for the mainland.

I am not a seaman.  But I heard it is no more than a week at sea.  I hope you are not too disappointed.

Not bad.

There must be a passage to that other ocean.

I am not listening, Father.  But I can't help hearing.

Really?  God... I wouldn't know where to start... and yet...

I'm not bargaining!

Forgive me, Don Colon.  But what about gold?

... for a commoner?

Don Bobadilla is already a judge, my Dear Don Cristobal.

What...?  Do I have so many already?

Call them.

Look out of that window.

Roofs... towers, palaces... spires...

What is it?  A tribe?  An island?

Tell the Chief we thank him.

Tell him his country is very beautiful.  Tell him we are leaving men here -- to build a fort.

Thousands.

Chief says -- he has a God.

He understands.

You did the same to your God!

You never learned how to speak my language.

Father, I am doing what I think is the best for him.  And he has the teacher I would have chosen for myself.

With some difficulty.  I had to promise them you were not a total fool.

Ignorance!  I believe the Indies are no more than 750 leagues west of the Canary Islands.

The calculations of Toscanelli Marin de Tyr, Esdras...

So was Christ!

I'll try to remember that, Marchena...

Passion is something one cannot control!

I've been contradicted all my life... Eternity!

Wait!  I've waited seven years already!  How much longer do you want me to wait?

Damn God!

Damn all of you!  You all set up theories based on what?  You never leave the safety of your studies! Go out!  Find out what the world is about and then tell me something I can listen to!

Colon!  Don't!

Forgive me, Father.  For I have sinned.

Father, I have betrayed my family. I betrayed my men.  And I betrayed you.

I lied.  The journey will be longer than I said.

I am not sure... It could be twice the distance.

If I tell them, they won't follow me.  You know that I am right, Father.  You trust me...

You are bound by an oath, Father.

You'll always be older than me, Father.

I knew you would.

What did they say about Granada before today?

Surely you can do anything you want.

You show no inclination to speak otherwise!

A woman?

Thirty seven, Your Majesty... And you?

They come and go as naked as the day God created them...

Thank you.

Your Majesty -- some men are content to read about things.  I must see them with my own eyes.  I cannot be other than I am.

The Indians have no such word, Don Moxica.

We don't need to know.

My horse doesn't work.

You did not hear me, Don Colon.  Not my horse.

You will regret this.

God be with us admiral.

And what do you think Mendez?

Come over here.

He's drawing an isthmus... He's saying we're on an isthmus.

Six days ago, yes.

We have to keep the hopes of these men alive!

The land is there.  I know it!

And then what?  Half of the water has gone, the rest is nearly putrid! You know that!

You never did.  You did all the talking for both of us, remember?

Pinzon, Pinzon... All we can do now is go forward!  Think about that!

You're right.  Let the men decide.

Never, Your Majesty.  Although...

Yes.  It would be a pity, wouldn't it?  Call him back!

Is this true, Brother Buyl?

He must be replaced.

Then why?

I'm not your lawyer until I see the money.

Emil.  Take it easy.  Stay with me.  Sit down.  What do you need?  What are you looking for?

Where are we going?

Yes.  Yes, come with me!

You bring the cigarettes?

I was all of these.

What about Oleg?

No, he is here.  Shit...

What about my movie rights?  Book rights?

What's your cut?  How much?

No.  No way.

Thirty-percent.  No more.  Or I call another lawyer.  This is the biggest case of your life.  Don't try to negotiate.  Thirty percent.  Say yes or no.

What else do you need?

My father always degraded me.  Killed my self-esteem.  And my mother was blind.

Yeah, she went blind giving birth to me. She went to fucking black market doctor to induce me.

Yeah, yeah...bad doctor gave her bad drugs which made her go blind.  And my father blamed me for her blindness...

Yeah, he hated me from day when I was born.  Put it out.  Can you put the cigarette out?

Your father put cigarettes out on you?

Can I see your back?

I don't think it's abuse, I think it's torture.

Officers, there's your killer, do your duty, arrest him!

If you cooperate with the DA - maybe they'll help you with your situation.

They won't until this is over.

Divorced.

So...the station is empty?

Yes, I considered it.

No.

No.

So you were never a prostitute?

I'm just trying to find out who you are.

I know.

They're not gonna send you right back.

I still can't believe Eddie's gone.

Ludwig?  He's gay - are you jealous?

If you were my boyfriend, I'd suggest you find another girlfriend that isn't going to jail ten-thousand miles away.

No matter what happens...I'm glad I met you.

Right.

I'll get my clothes.

Pouring it out!

...Do you really want me to forget about you?

C'mon, start at the beginning.  You know these people?

Go on.

If I tell you, will you arrest me?

No, no, don't talk to Immigration!

You're a cop - you'll never believe me.

It was my decision, not his.

I'm ready to be briefed.  Excuse us.

Who do you think, Chief?!

'Cause we got more important things to do, like finding out who did it.

I came to see how the investigation was going.  I called and you're not here.  I wait up at the station and you don't even show up!!!  I beep you - you don't return my call.  Where the hell have you been?!

What do you mean, 'cleaned up?'

A shower!?  Did you take one, too?

Oh really.  That's nice.  You took a homicide witness to take a shower after your partner was shot?  Are you out of your fucking mind??  Are you having that much trouble gettin' dates?!

What was I supposed to do?  The guy tried to mug me.  I was gonna send a cop back - I just forgot.

Chief - I know I screwed up - but this guy was no innocent civilian.

But Chief?  Over this??

Yeah, right.

I said, yeah, you're right, Chief.  As soon as we get somethin' we'll let you alert the media.

Yeah.  He finished awhile ago.

Vodka tonic.

What's the kid gonna say - sorry? Meanwhile I'm not here anymore. Like last week - we were at the morgue and this guy was all chopped up - spleen here - liver there - his heart in a pan. Six hours ago this guy was walkin' his dog or buyin' a quart of milk.  Who knows?  But some kid's robbed him for $3 or some shit and shot him and now you can't tell if he's a piece of beef or a human being and I'm thinkin' that's me. Sooner or later.  That's me.

When?

You ready?

Takin' a bath.

No.  I'm okay.

I know.  Relax.  Take it easy.  Don't worry, we'll get those fuckers.

Police.  We'd like to ask you a few questions.

Homicide, Miss Hearn.  It's Detective Eddie Flemming.  Open up.

Do you have any Czech girls working for you?

Did you tell him you did?

What are you saying?

Describe him.

No, we don't mind.  You mind Leon?

No, what is it?

Watch the news?

Well, just so you know.  I gave you guys the credit.

Nah, why should you?

Good.  Good.  Commendable.

Sure.  But I would like to ask you something.  You got a problem with me?

Pretty.

Maybe you don't care about that either.  Prettiest suspect I've had in awhile.

Look, I'm not even sure she has anything to do with this.  I saw her outside after the fire - thought it was a lead. Maybe she saw something.  Maybe she was visiting somebody here.  Who knows?

Eastern Europe.  Like what?  Romania? Hungary?

There wasn't a fire.  There'll be nothing for you to do.

This isn't homicide school.

You're Polish?

Stay here.

You got any better ideas?

This has nothing to do with your fire.

This is ridiculous.  I'm not gonna be in your way - we can talk the case over.

I'll call it... tails.

Better than one.

I'm on my way with Eddie.  Ludwig's. 63rd and Madison.  The suspects might be there already.

Of course.

I wanted to run up to a building on fire, kick in the door, rush into the smoke and save a kid.

She just saw two of her friends killed! They probably threatened her.

Something back home?

You wanna talk to her alone?

What would your girlfriend think of that?

So am I.

You're her Savior?  Is she the kid you're gonna save from the burning building?

Well, you shoulda because nobody's gonna believe you didn't...including me.

Just a shower?

Well, it's not up to you to decide whether she's innocent or not.  Don't you understand, that's why you're a professional.

How you go out on a limb for somebody is by giving her a number of an Immigration lawyer.  Here, here's a number of an Immigration lawyer.  That's how you help her. But you can't get involved in her like that.  You're gonna jeopardize your career, your life and you're gonna jeopardize my case.  And lemme give you another piece of advice.  Maybe you don't watch TV but I'll let you in on a little secret - the whole fuckin' world watches television.  And when you get out there, they know your face.  And the little fame, the little fuckin' itty bitty fame that I get in this city makes it a lot easier for my job.  And I get more done because of it.

You know, I don't know.  I like you. You remind me of a puppy I used to have. He pissed on the rug all the time, but I still kept him.

What's your accomplishment.

If you kill me and film it you're putting a noose around your neck.

Smarter than Americans.  You're fed cry baby talk shows all day long.  Not only will Americans believe me, they'll cry for me.  So...Detective Eddie Flemming, would you like to say goodbye to your Nicolette? Maybe you can propose to her now?

We don't know that yet.  It's much too early.  There's a lot to be done.

There are two bodies found at this point.

You know you can't do that.  C'mon.

We don't know.  When I have more I'll let you know.

I can't talk right now.  We have some things to take care of.

I really can't give out any information right now at this point.

He was hurt, but not seriously.  He'll be fine.

Um...now is not a good time, okay. Detective Jackson's hurt.  He's fine. I've got a Fire Marshall shot, Detective Jackson is hurt but not seriously.

Yeah.  Now's not a good time.

Alright?

I can't...I can't answer you just because you want me to answer you!

Oh, I'm sorry.  Did I embarrass you, sweetheart?  Oh...

Maybe I should just, ya know...turn to the cameras and say, do you mind if we just work something out?

I'm not.

You were merciless.  You didn't give a shit if you got me or not.

You're ruthless.

Could be Leon's.

Answer the phone.

Answer it.

Well, that's great.

No.  Go ahead.  You're gonna be great.

I'll tell you tonight.  Let's do it tonight.  As soon as you get back we'll talk.  We'll talk.

I promise.  We'll talk.  You'll be great.  You'll be fine.  Go ahead, just imagine that, uh... Just look into the lens and imagine you're talking to me.

Patronizing you... Nay, I love you.

Tonight.

Yeah.  I promise.

Yeah, yeah.  Good thing.

See you later.  Good luck.

Don't be late.

Jesus Christ.

Not chopped up.  Not chopped up like that.  I mean, what do I got left? Coupla articles.  A medal or two. Plaque here and there and in a coupla years no one remembers me anymore.

I'm not moody.

My kids?  Let's see...Susan's 15. Aundrea's 9.  Don't tell me you're thinking about having a kid!  How old are you?  Never mind. Let me just tell you this: Every stupid cliche you hear about kids - they change your life, they make you a better person, they make you whole...  It's all true!  Before I had kids when friends talked about their kids, I wanted to vomit.  Now -- I get it.  Am I right, Leon?

Not what.  Who.

That's unique.

Keep them out of my way.

Yeah, yeah.  Jesus.

Again?  I didn't wanna do it the first time.

I am butcher.

You stuff sausage in it.

No.  Are you proposing?

Look asshole.  I've been threatened by better than you.

I'll meet you on one condition - I get exclusivity and you surrender to me.

What?  It doesn't work that way.

Get down on your knees.

The Sheraton!  On Broadway!  Room 210. Go get Oleg.  He'll kill you.

Where's Czech girl?

I ordered a Czech girl.  Daphne, you know her?

Where is escort service?

I like to talk to the person who runs the service.  Can you give me address?

Look, man, I don't give a shit if you want sex or not, but you're payin' for my time.

Alright, alright - don't hurt me! Please, it's in my book, in my purse!

Yes sir.

Two weeks holiday.

I have five-hundred dollars.

Yes.

Is there a problem?

I'd like to speak for himself, okay?

New York's finest.  This is his case.

Million?!  The killer gets one million dollars for a television interview?

Yes.  Both.

Okay.

Don't speak Russian!

Because I don't like your ugly language. I heard enough of it in school!  Now speak Czech or English.  And don't fool around anymore.  You almost got us thrown out!

We have no money.  Come on.

Why should I carry your bag?  I am not a dog.

I'm not filming.  I'm watching Milos die.  It's just like a move but realer.

You said speak Czech!

I'm homesick.  You have Eastern European girl?  A Czech girl?

Shut up.

Don't want to film this?

The video of Milos and Tamina - I told you to erase it.

And the whore's murder?  You didn't erase that either, did you?  Don't lie, I won't be angry.

Put the camera down, Oleg.

What does it look like?  It's an address book!

Good idea!

Cut!

Oleg, don't be paranoid.  You got a hundred-fifty thousand dollars, didn't you?  I gave you half of what they gave me.  Look - here we are!

Be quiet.  Watch.

Because I am the director.  Don't you realize, if it wasn't for my film, for my talent, my idea to do this - no way would we be sitting here right now.

Credit?

Yes.  But there's only one problem - you want credit but the problem is - I don't share credit.

No, I don't get that!

No.  You are the traitor.  You are murderer.  I am director.  Action!

Did you hurt her?

Milos.  Get my money!

Ha. Ha.

A job?

As a plumber?!

A job??  As a plumber???  You think I come to America to work!

You spent all the money while I was in prison?  Now you tell me to get a job fixing toilets?!?

What are you doing here?

You want the tape?  There it is!

Of course he's moody.  He thinks he's in love.

Paulie, you've got kids, right?

This footage will work in your favor. When the jury sees this - no matter what Cutler tries, they'll convict him.

If I didn't put it on somebody else would!  I was his friend!

Alright.  Go ahead.

Okay.  You're a Czech national and you're a Russian national.  How do you know one another?

Then answer my questions.  Where were you planning to stay during the two weeks that you're here?

Yes, we're in New York now.  But where are you planning to stay in New York?

What are you coming here to do?

Movies...to be in the movies or to see movies?

Excuse me?

Thanks.  Appreciate it.

That's what it looks like to me.

Evidence.  Of a homicide.

No way!  He's mine!

He's my collar!

He's yours but I take him in!  I'll drive him to the precinct, you can have him but I'm walkin' him in.

Look, I don't have time for you, get out of my way!!

Fire Department?  Firemen don't carry guns.

Hey.  C'mon, you can't leave me like this.  Some freak'll come by and stab me!

A dog pissed on me!!  I'm gonna sue you for this!  You violated my civil rights!

Yeah, I'm religious.  I'm not an Atheist like you!  Now, are you guys gonna arrest me, or not?

Hey, by the way, I'm really sorry about your wife leavin' you.

I heard.  Who the hell let them up there?

You see anything in the crowd?  Anybody suspicious?

Oh yeah, why?

Could you put out the cigar?  Part of the job is picking up scents.

Clean?

He knew all along.

That's why he was so quiet.  He was testing us.

There was a woman - I think she wanted to talk to us.  She looked scared.  Oh shit!  Oh no!

Aren't you tired?

It hurts.  Aw, Jesus!

What the hell happened?

Capra?  That's not Czech or Russian. Who said he sounded Russian?

Don't you get it?  He knew he was gonna get caught!  That's why he videotaped Eddie's murder - he thinks he's gonna get off.

Look, you can't shoot him in cold blood.

Your doctor?

...so you feel absolutely no responsibility for killing these people?

You seem very savvy for a man who's been found mentally incompetent to stand trial.

Permanently disrupted?  Aren't you selling paintings now for quite a lot of money?  Hasn't this 'incident' as you call it, jump started your career as an artist?

And isn't there a movie in the works about you?

But doesn't the Son of Sam Law prevent criminals from profiting from their crimes?

Well, how nice to see you again, Elena. You're looking wonderful.

She's wonderful.

Well, I suppose they've been having a bit of trouble with some of the equipment.

How did they manage to do that without any communication?

I'm sorry, Dr. Smyslov, but I'm really not at liberty to discuss this.

We're trying to get there. I hope we can.

Right. Just a sec.

Sure, what is it?

What's up?

Yes?

Interesting that you mention it, because I've got the same problem.

Yes.

It's possible.

I don't think we should make any fuss about it yet. I'm sure they'll straighten it out.

No. I never did, either.

I suppose so. Though, of course, there's a more sinister explanation.

Just ask Hal. It's conceivable they might keep something from us, but they'd never keep anything from Hal.

Yes, but it's to fantastic to think that they'd keep something from us.

But not completely inconceivable?

Yes, I don't know what to make of it.

Yes, but it's more likely that the tolerances on our testing gear are too low.

Are you reasonably awake?

No.

Two units in four days. How many spares do we have?

Well, I hope there's nothing wrong with the assembly on those. Other- wise we're out of business.

Yes.

Well, now that we've got one that's actually failed, we should be able to figure out what's happened and fix it.

I guess you don't know your own strength, old boy.

I understand Hal. We'll take care of it. Please, let me have the hard copy.

Yes, I know.

Yes, I know that. But I can assure you that they were about to fail.

Hal, is there anything bothering you?  Anything that might account for this problem?

Okay, Hal, well let's see the way things go from here on.

I'm sorry about the misunderstanding, Hal.

Yes, it is, Hal.

Yes, it is.

The antenna has to be replaced.

It doesn't have to be, Hal. It's more dangerous to be out of touch with Earth. Let me have manual control, please.

I'm goin to do this myself, Hal. Let me have the control, please.

Hal, switch to manual hibernation control.

Hal, I'm in command of this ship. I order you to release the manual hibernation control.

Hal, unless you follow my instructions, I shall be forced to disconnect you.

I know that you've had that on your mind for some time now, Dave, but it would be a crying shame, since I am so much more capable of carrying out this mission than you are, and I have such enthusiasm and confi- dence in the mission.

Did they have any explanation for this?

Well... it's silly, but... if you want to, why don't you?

Still, you really don't believe it, do you?

Well, the only important aspect of the mission are: where are we going, what will we do when we get there, when are we coming back, and... why are we going?

I'm fine, Daddy. When are you coming home?

Yes, I know that sweetheart.

No, I'm sorry, darling, I told you I won't be home for a few days.

In three days, darling, I hope.

Mommy's out to the hair- dresser.

She's in the bathroom.

How many days until you come home?

Yes, Daddy.

Goodbye, Daddy.

Thank you.

I suppose it was bound to happen sooner or later.

Yes, well, whatever it is, they're certainly not fooling around. This is the first flight they allowed in for more than a week.

I'll bet it's a fortune.

Oh, she's growing up very fast. As a matter of fact, she's six tomorrow.

Well, where are all of you off to?

Well, that does sound very odd.

No, thank you... and I'm afraid now I really must be going.

Thank you. It's been a great pleasure to meet all of you... Dr. Smyslov.

Please, it really doesn't matter.

Yes, very pleasant.

Fine.

I suppose you saw the work on our new section while you were docking.

Well, it's just for the past two weeks there have been some extremely odd things happening at Clavius.

Yes. Well, for one thing, whenever you phone the base, all you can get is a recording which repeats that the phone lines are temporarily out of order.

You mean you haven't been able to get anyone at the base for ten days?

I see.

Yes... Well, I hope the crew got back safely.

Well, I'm glad about that.

Certainly.

Dr. Smyslov... I'm not permitted to discuss this.

I'm afraid it can and it will be kept under wraps as long as it is deemed to be necessary by the Council. And of course you know that the Council has requested that formal security oaths are to be obtained in writing from every- one who had any knowledge of this event. There must be adequate time for a full study to be made of the situation before any con- sideration can be given to making a public announcement.

Any clue as to what it is?

Well, not really. At first glance, black would suggest something sun-powered, but then why would anyone deliberately bury a sun- powered device?

There's nothing like weightless sleep for a complete rest.

Incidentally, Dr. Floyd, I wonder if I can have a word with you about the security arrangements?

I take it this is something to do with the trouble they're having up at Clavius?

I see. Well, I'm sorry about that. I wouldn't think there's any cause for alarm.

No, of course, Captain, I can understand your concern.

I will if I can, Frank.

That's true.

Approximately five years after we go into hibernation, the recovery vehicle will make rendezous with us and bring us back. Is this true?

There is no other purpose for this mission than to carry out a continuation of the space program, and to further our general knowledge of the planets. Is that true?

Thank you very much, Hal.

Roger.

Hal, maintain normal E.V.A. condition.

Opening pod bay doors.

It looks like we have another bad A.O. unit. My FPC shows another impending failure.

Let me see the tracking alignment display.

Not really, Frank. I think there may be a flaw in the assembly procedure.

I want to pick up my car.

Yeah, I've been busy.

How about chargin' the battery?

Great, just great.

Vodka.

No, man, I think I'll have a vodka.

Fuck off.  I don't know what the hell you're talkin' about.

I don't give a shit who you ask.

Look, give me a break, you're going to have to settle for her place.  It's the only thing I know.

Try obeyin' the law once in awhile, and I won't have to hassle you...

You got a real big mouth, convict.

I ain't tired yet.

Yeah, dummy.  Money.

It's better when you pay... they let you do anything.

Just do what I say, okay? We'll pay for the girls and have a good time... Don't you trust me?

He's just kiddin', you just keep doin' what I tell ya, you'll be okay.

And I need one more for my pal. Yeah. Make her an Indian. No, not a turban, you know, a squaw.

Goodbye.

Here you go sweetheart, throw it my way.

No, baby, nothin' like that. Look, there's a place across the street. We can go right over there...

I just struck it rich... I think we can do a little business.  As a matter of fact, I think we can have a party.

Hey, don't do that.  I said I wasn't a pro, remember?

Now you're talkin'. See ya...

Don't give me that police shit. You drop it.

I used to go with him...I don't know where the hell he is.  I haven't seen him for two weeks. And I don't think I will.  He owes me money...

Would you guys...

Yeah.  Sure, i'm crazy in love with him, who wouldn't be...

No chance.

In the back.  Down the other corridor.

What are you talking about? We didn't kill her ...

I don't think you're gonna make it.

You're done.  End of story.

I can deliver Ganz.  But you gotta get me outta here first.

I can help you, man, but you gotta get me out.  I got to be on the street.  Get me outta here.

I got a lot to protect.

It's the only way you're gonna get Ganz.

What are you talkin' about?  This suit's mine.  It cost $900.

Listen, it may be a little out of date. You know, I got a reputation for lookingreal sharp with the ladies...

You got a girl... shit... the generosityof women never ceases to amaze me.

You just don't get it, do your Reggie?  There isn't any deal. I own your ass.

Get this.  We ain't partners. We ain't brothers.  We ain't friends. I'm puttin' you down and keepin' you down until Ganz is locked up or dead.  And if Ganz gets away, you're gonna be sorry we ever met.

It looks like you bought it off one of the brothers.

Don't worry, I got a move for ya. An awesome move. A guy named Luther. Ganz'll be paying him a visit.  We go to him right away.

Then what're you complainin' about? At least nobody's calling you shithead....

Your pal nuts enough to take a shot at me?

I'm helpin' you, huh?

I'm tellin' you to drop the Goddam gun.

Thank you.

If you let him run around till Tuesday, he's gonna run right to Ganz and warn him. Ain't you, motherfucker?

Do you know how close I was to getting some trim.  And you fucked' it up.

Speakin' of moans my Stomach is startin' to growl.

Bullshit ... I ain't moving  till I get something to eat. You've been treating me like shit ever since I came out here.  If you don't like it, you can take me back to the penitentiary and kiss my hungry black ass good-bye.  And I want some food some place nice.. Some good people, nice music...

Yeah, I want mandolins, flowers... They move off down the corridor.

Just get in the car and keep your mouth shut.

Mission District.  Gonna find us an Indian.

Last night, two nights ago, three?

You have a good time?

At least you took care of business and got the important part in before she came down on you...Tell me a little about her.  She got great tits?

It's a long shot, but...Billy used to tend bar here a few years back. I heard him talk about it.

Back you up?  Now why would I wanna do that?

You need five years training to handle a joint like...

I got two problems.  Number one, I'm not playin' games.  Number two, you got nothin' to bet with.

Why?  Anybody that talks about women as much as you do probably can't get it up anyway.

What are you talkin' about?

I don't know what you're talking about. I just wanna see Ganz nailed.

My kind of place. I always liked country boys.

Some of us citizens are with you all the way, Officer.

While you're at it, You can give me the switchblade, too.

Must be billy's girl.

Wait a minute.  Maybe these ladies would like to go a few laps with us.  How about it? I been nearly three years in prison and...

Who gives a Goddamn what you think? You're just a crook that's got a weekendpass ... You're not even a name anymore. Just a spear- chucker with a Goddamn number stenciled on the back of his prison fatigues...

Naw, you'd just call your pals back to bail you out one more time.

How much?

Jesus.

You catch on real fast...Okay, Jack, let's talk deal. How much of my money you gonna let me keep?

Not likely, convict.

Depends on how things work out. I believe in the merit system. So far you haven't built up any points.

In the trunk of a car.  A lot better than under a mattress, right?

You're a real case, you know that, Jack?

...For three years?  Let's hope it wasn't a tow-away zone.

I wasn't sure the money was still there until we saw Luther. You almost got your ass shot off for nothing once, not twice, Jack.

Not really.  I figured Ganz was put down for a long time.  And I knew Luther would never job me on his own.  He's too chickenshit.

Musta got some primo bondsman.

Didn't know you darker people went in for foreign jobs.

Tryin' to save his girl, man. He's in another world.

I'm not in this 'cause it's fun. I'm not into hitting guys 'cause it makes me feel good either... I do it 'cause it works-...

If he's hoping that then he's dumber than I think he is, which would be amazin', cause I already think he's real dumb.

Yeah, it doesn't look like he's gonna make it as a dangerous tough guy...

What you don't understand is, I don't give a damn about how this thing looks.

Class isn't somethin' you buy, punk. Look at you, five hundred dollar suit and you're still a lowlife.

Yeah, most cops are pretty dumb... But since you're the one that landed in jail what's that make you?

Right. if you ever switch from armed robbery to pimping, then you're all set.

You stay with me...

I'll be there in a minute. You don't move your ass, right?

Be polite. Say hello.  This is Candy.

What about Ganz?

You missed ... Luther took a taxi to the hotel across the street. Made a phone call.

Let him get some sleep.  He's going to need it.

So you took the rest of the night off...

Forget it. I want Ganz as bad as you do and I got some other news for you...

You sure that's the reason?

Bein' good at your job don't explain everything, Jack ...

When you been in prison three years, it don't take long. Let's go.

Yeah. It missed the last four stops.

I had it impounded.  Come on, we'll use it for haulin' you back to the slam.

I don't know about you, but I could use a drink... I'll buy you one.  It'll be my good-bye present.

Naw, you didn't let me down.  It was a long shot all the way.  We gave 'em a good run at it.

Don't worry about it.

If she's right, and if you don't screw up.

Whatever play I maker just back me up.

Sure, I'll give you a shot at it, but Ganz is mine.  You know, that big Indian plays it for keeps...

Partnership?

Yeah.  But I wasn't there for a second.

There's nothin' to talk about.

And you're tellin' me you don't want any of this cash?

You are an awesomely weird cop. Sure wish there were more like you runnin' around out here.

Spare met Jack. I'm into legit investments from here on in.

No trouble, Jack. But, listen, suppose I stay a crook?  Where'd you get the idea that you could catch me?

Yeah, I read the report...

Jack, come on, there is an official department policy about cop killings. Cop killers represent a special priority because any man crazy enough to kill a cop is a greater threat to an unarmed civilian... In other words, we can't seen like we're in the revenge business... I know, we all know the truth's a little different.

Anthing botherin' you besides losin' your gun?

You might be more of a team player and a little less of a hot dog on this one, Jack.

Okay.  You're not a team player. You gotta do things your own way. Fine.  Nail this guy and make us all look good.  But you better watch your ass.  If you screw up, I can promise you, you're goin' down.

Jack?

Try not to get your ass shot to pieces. We got enough dead cops on this one.

I lost them, that's what happened.

They ran.  As fast as they could. Caught a train.

The Indian.  I was about 30 yards away.

Right.  I screwed up.  I fucked up. I messed up.  Anybody could have done better, especially you. I bet you're real good at hitting targets through crowds.

Just cause you say it with conviction don't mean shit to me... How you gonna take to a pink slip, huh?.

I'm taking my prisoner back to jail.

Yeah.

Are you gonna tell me about police procedure?  Do me a favor, don't give me a bunch of crap.

Every last bit of it.  The big guy's room was empty.

Shit.

They all pulled a bunch of jobs with Ganz about four years ago.

Uhh ... Wong, Henry Wong.  He was in on the same job.

Hey ... Dick Tracy.

Here's the file. Cates checks the file.

Okay.  See you in the morning... you know, you ought to get some rest...

What?

I'm not paid to take your personal calls.  He was in some bar. .. off duty.

I sure ain't his fairy godmother... now I'm looking for Ganz...where is he?

You just took a shot at me, asshole. I think you do know where he is.

I think I met her.  Now tell us something we don't know, like where they stashed her.

When? How?

I don't answer questions, I ask 'em...

This is a .44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world. You gotta ask yourself just one question. Are you feelin' lucky?

What'd you do?

I guess he got the message...

Positive self-image problem all over again ... You are who you decide you are unless you're the type that lets assholes decide for you.

I do think all psychotherapy is bullshit. But just because I think it's bullshit doesn't mean I don't know something about it.

Hey, you know what I really think?

I think you're ashamed to tend bar which is sad because you look great in that outfit they make you wear... You pull down four bills a week which is damn good, and you mix the best Pina Coladas I've ever had... I think that if you need bigger and better things ... then go for em.

Maybe I would if I knew when you were coming back.

Maybe I got a fairly crummy day ahead.

Maybe you don't know what the hell you're talking about.

That's the way I see it, too.

You sure you want me to?

I think you forgot this. Hands him his wallet and badge...

Yeah, one of my favorites.

Jack, are you okay?

Bullshit?  I'll tell you about bullshit.  My gun's a real weapon in the hands of a real maniac who knows how to use it.  It isn't my macho bullshit that's killing people, my gun is ...

That's right.  I'm not like you. I'm not gonna sit on my ass wondering what's right and what's wrong... There's a psycho out there killing people with my gun and I'm gonna get him.  Because it's my job. And if you don't get that...

This is not the way people who care for each other are supposed to behave.

No, it's I'm just surprised you called.

Jack?  What was that?

Jack, wait...

Hi, it's me...

Hiya, kid.

Don't.  We've had a hard night.

Ganz is going to be hard to track. Just a pure schizo ... wires all crossed... totally without any pattern... kill anybody... The Indian... himself... anybody...

Jack, it's all over the papers. He's an obvious type.  But this Indian...

Come on, they were a little old for a slumber party.

So what?

Hey, Come on, shrink time's over. They wouldn't go see some old girlfriend.

What do I know?  I'm just a bartender.

Usual bullshit.  You make one smart move and everybody wants to be your friend... You know somethin', shootin' guys sucks. Especially compared to this.

Yeah, bein' a hard-ass all the time is a real drag, but it works.

Where is he?

Tell me.

Well, I been workin' the other side of the street for the last few years.  And you don't exactly look like a shrink, wearin' that dress...

How would you know?

Shut up.

Shut up.

What do you want?

Alright, I'm coming...hold on.

Can't complain.

Yeah, old times.

Sure, right.

Whaddya want?  I thought you were locked up-

I don't know what you're talkin' about.

I can't get it until Monday. Honest.

First, the money.

Naw, right here's okay.

I'm sure.  Everybody here's looking at everybody else's ass.

It's loaded... I got some shells in here.

This is clean shit.  No serial numbers and never been used...

Five bills.

This ain't a credit business.

Give it back.

I'll got your money to you. No sweat.

Napoleon... small.

San Agamat chay bet... envolet!

You know exactly where they are!

No, I'm not proud of myself... But we don't have the luxury of choice.

I can't pretend to be your husband... David's in great shape.

I remember you now..the so called art dealer.

...Why on earth do the stones interest you?

Even it I did know where the stones were I would never tell somebody like you.

...I'm a priest! I'm here to serve life, All you want to do is destroy it.

No thank you.

They are robots!

Weddings are one floor down. Congratulations.

That's me.  But I don't know who she is... where did you find her?

I brought the girl remember?

You noticed...

She's an exception..

Dallas. Korben Dallas.

I might call to check up on her, you know... to see if she's better?

I know. I was there when she arrived.

It means, "Never without my permission".

What kind of mission?

Father, I was in the Army for awhile and every time they told us we were on a mission to save the world the only thing that changed was I lost a lot of friends. So thanks for the offer.. but no thanks.

Trying to save your ass so you can save the world.

Yeah, I know... to save the world... but right now all I want to do is save Leeloo.

When is she not in trouble?

Theoretically, yes! The four Stones form the beam and the Fifth Element is supposed to stand in the middle there, but... I don't have the reference book. I've never seen the Stones work!

Yes, of course, but... The Stones are shut! They have to be open for it to work.

That's what I'm saying.

One more reason to shoot first eh?

Time is of no importance, Mr. President. Only life is important.

And then?

Yes..thank God..

White turns to black.  Light to Dark. Life to Death.  For all eternity.

This is government business now. You ought to go home and get some rest, Father.

Absolutely sure There's the triple suns on her gloves!

Learning our history! The last 5000 years that she missed! She's been out of circulation a while, you know.

Yes. Of course..

I didn't know your size.

Perfect.

Good work, my son.  Now all we need is a way to get there.

On the plane... with Mr. Dallas... the real one.

Later, David! Later! There's not a minute to lose!

Who?

Yes, and more than that... You must give her the Stones, she's the only one who knows how to use them.

I'll help her, I promise, but I think you should tell me where the Stones are!

I... I don't know! We hardly know each other... it takes time!

Hey bud! Finger here.

I was talking to the cat.

Don't exist bud.

How do I look?

You forgetting who sat next to you for a thousand missions. I know how you drive.

How many points you got left on your license?

Hey bud...I'm waiting all day here.

Leeloo..

...'Scuse me?

It there's one thing I don't need advice on, it's how to drive.

You're not that bad... Come on we'll get you to a doctor.

Vito Cornelius?

I'm sorry, it's just that... I was told to wake you up gently, so I figured...

Leeloo Minai Lekarariba-Laminai-Tchai Ekbat De Sebat.

...Leeloo.

Take them and put them in a safe place.

When mankind comes to its senses. We will return.

We will be ready, Lord.

You're the nastiest dirtbag I know in this stinking City!

I've been playing twice a week for 20 years, 20 years I've been eating those shitty croquettes.

Yes ma..

I get it! You want to make me beg, is that it?

Ma. If I'd won, I'd know about it. Someone would have notified me.

Have you pulled yourself together?

You little sleaze bag!

Don't you ever ask me for another thing in my life again, you've killed your poor mother with your own hands!

Thanks for reminding me..

This is a police control action..

Found it?

Does it get any better or what!

Uh... not really.

Crystal.

I'll take you to the bar, after that, you're on your own.

I don't think this is a good time...

Yeah, very big, a giant.

Got it...

Not without Leeloo.

I'll be right back.

It's like a cab isn't it?

Fuck it! Hold tight!

Dear listeners, your favorite DJ is alive and kicking. It's seven o'clock and time for the news. Tune in tomorrow for another adventure.

Nothing! Swear to God, I didn't do nothing!

Yeah... then I sighed... like this.

Where have I heard this song before?

Just one... why me?

And the third one?

I've had enough good news for today

What is it?

I thought you were divorced.

Three of us will never fit in there!

I suppose that means "Hi" ?

Uh..you're welcome.

Cornelius..

Took the words right out of my mouth. Go on... I'll be right with you.  It's our honeymoon. We're going to use the trip to get to know each other better.

Yes! But "love" isn't the operative word here, PEACE is!

What is... Make Love?

All 900.

Yes! Now it's your turn! I learned your language, you have to learn mine!

Apipoussan!

Good! Do you know how we say "make love"?

...Hoppi-hoppa.

You know women normally change five times more than men.

Yes... you know there's a lot of differences between men women.

OK, you can turn around!

I'm going to see the Diva sing. What's the matter?... Do I look bad?

And you can't concentrate with me around?.

The words you're looking for weren't in the dictionary you studied. I won't be long.

Why? We did pretty well, wouldn't you say?

I told you not to read all that crap!

The wind blows... the fire burns...

...The rain falls...

I'm so tired...

You're right but there are lots of good things... beautiful things...

Yes, you do! I need you. More than you can imagine! Stand up straight!

Because...

I love you...

I've never gotten a message that wasn't bad news.

The last two messages I got?  The first one was from my wife telling me she was leaving! And the second was from my lawyer telling me he was leaving too... with my wife.

Good philosophy..see good in bad.. I like..I prepare number one dessert.. special for you and pussy..

Been here long?

You gotta push the little yellow button...

Actually only one cell survived..

It's not that easy..we've never encountered anything like it before..you see normal human beings have 40 DNA memo groums..which is more than enough for any species to perpetuate itself..This one has 200,000.

This cell is like a huge library. It has infinite genetic knowledge stored inside. Almost like it was...engineered.

Yes... I can't wait to meet him.

Is there any danger? Some kind of virus?

Wonderful!

An elephant couldn't crack it.

It's an honor to receive you. Mr. President.

And the Stones?  Did you find them in the wreckage?

...What do you mean?

Don't worry, Sir. I have the perfect one.

How much time is left?

I can hear you, Mr. President, but I can't see you .

Perfect, Mr. President.

There are no results from the chemical and molecular analysis as of yet, all the calibers are overshot..we're hoping a thermo nucleatic imaging..

Options.

Recommendations.

Gentlemen?

"..in which all the history of the Universe resides ..all the strength..all the hope..Protect us from Evil.."

Only too well... here you must be parched..

Then let us toast to your fame!  Here Billy..

To fame.. salud..

Right away, Sir. I'll send you a new one to the hotel.

No... not at all.  Where are you?

Really? Maybe I can get you on my screen and see you at last!

Got it.

Fine, just fine!  I'll have the 4 pieces you asked for any time now.  But it wasn't easy. My costs have tripled.

...I can't wait to be among you.

Do you know how much I missed you?

Smoking?  I'm not smoking.

Well, I'm not smoking, okay?

Honey, I'm not, please...

I love you.

Sure.  I'll call the guy.

I'm not using him again for anything.  He was worthless.  You have bridge here Saturday?

I understand.

I know.

Amy, it's me.  Listen very carefully..

What's wrong?  Are you alright?

I'm okay, honey, I'm okay.  Are you alright?

I can't tell you, Amy.  You know I can't.  You have to trust me...

It has to be this way for now.  It won't be long.

I don't know.  I'm sorry...

You don't understand...

I was in hell.  If I called you... if I heard your voice... it would have been so easy for me to quit. I couldn't do that.

Amy, I'm not going to let anything happen to us.

I don't know what to say

Don't...

Amy...

Mrs. Christian.

She's all I've got.  She's the only witness.

I just talked to her.

Mixed hard bondage.  Rape films. Sick shit.  Buy five, get one free.

There's nothing harder.

What you see is what I got, mister.

I just got a call... two seconds ago, some motherfucker called... says he knows about the loop.

The loop!  The girl we did, what the fuck do you think I'm talking about?!  This guy calls and says he knows about the fucking loop...

I'm telling you...

Because somebody just fucking called me and fucking laid it out!

Dino...

I promised him to Machine.

What can I do for you today?

Flattering.  And, who's your colorful little chum?

Hmm.

Yes.  What we're looking for is rather specific.

Is it?

And they are?

I'll consider it.

Machine.

We can do that.

I'd rather you didn't.

Those are two different kinds of trust.  Thank you for your time.  I hope we can do business.

Machine's in?

Brooklyn.  Don't be late.

Hmm?  Oh, the knifes?  They're just props.  Nice, aren't they?

What are you... ?

Look, I don't know what this...

I remember him.

Look, he's got nothing to do with this... let him go...

He doesn't know anything... he's got nothing to do with this...

How cooperative.  Longdale will keep you company.

Put the gun down, take the handcuffs.  Handcuff yourself to the bed.

Move it, dirtbag... !

Leave him alone.

First things first.  You might want to watch this, Mr. Welles...

You betrayed us.

Call me Tom.

What I'd like, very simply, is access to your archive.  And, now I understand this isn't something you normally do for private citizens...

Absolutely.  Of course I'll abide by whatever decision you make, but I'd appreciate if you'll hear me out...

Why not go to the N.C.I.C. or N.C.M.E.C.?

Why don't they come to me?

I'm not so sure about this.

I can give you my card, if your clients want to call me...

Any good?

You're gonna be seeing a lot of me. You're sure you don't mind?

Eddie.

I know what you did.

You murdered that girl, Eddie.  Six years ago...

One million dollars, Dino.  How much did he tell you he had...

Don't bore me with that bullshit.

Fuck you!

What do you want?

I don't know...

I told you, I don't know.

What the fuck am I gonna protect that freak for?  He was Dino's boy, not mine.  He shows up with his mask on, leaves with his mask on.  Nobody knows.

Yeah, the fucking lawyer.

Yeah.

Thirty thousand each, that fucking cocksucker.

It was a lot of fucking money.

Something like that.

What the fuck do you want from me?

Fuck you then, you want to know?  I talked her up, told her how beautiful she was, told her she was gonna be a star.  I told her I was gonna get her a screen test, and while I'm doing that, I got her a soda and dropped a mickey.  When it was dark enough, I rang Dino and told him it was go time, I put her in the trunk of my car and we went and we fucking did it.  That's what happened.  She's dead.  She's been dead a long fucking time.  Nobody fucking cares!

You enjoy it?

What did you do with her body?

Show me.

Where do you think you're taking this, huh?  Gonna be a big hero, avenge that little girl's death? Gonna make everything right with the world?  How you gonna do that... ?

Stop talking.

Show me where you buried her.

Where?  Show me where.

Don't think I won't.

Easy enough for you.

Get together some upscale product where the girls still have teeth in their head.  Till then, fuck you.

I'm listening.

Of what sort?

Wouldn't exactly have been possible for a man of his stature.

That's trust.  Mr. Christian trusted me implicitly.

Never mind how I found you.

They're no friends of mine.

None of this would be happening if you would have left it alone.  If you weren't digging up a girl who died six years ago.  A girl no one even remembers.

Shut up.

Shut your mouth and drive!

Just tell me.  Tell me some more of the secrets you and Christian shared. What kind of degenerate pervert was he really?  What the fuck did he want with a snuff film?

I'm asking.

Why did he buy a film of some poor, lost girl getting butchered?

Enlighten me.

Fuck you.

You'll get it when we get there.

Go ahead, shoot me.  Then try driving to Brooklyn with my brains all over the windshield.

Look at him.  You think he played it square?  How much did he give you, how much did he keep for himself?

Yeah... guess so.

Pardon me?

Well, it's tempting, but no thanks.

I'll risk it.

Catchy title.  What are you really reading?  Hard to believe that book's got any parts worth highlighting.

Might get drummed out of the pornographer's union, and then where would I be?

Came back for that battery-operated vagina, right?  Told you you would.

Thomas Welles.  Nice picture.

Good for you.

Max.

There's not much illegal.

You're not a cop, are you?  If I ask and you are, you have to tell me.

You're a private eye.  Like Shaft.

From Pennsylvania.  P.I. from PA. What are you doing out here?

Four hundred a week, off the books.

Sounds good, pops.

Child pornography.

What other ways are there to get illegal films?  Who do you see?

Twenty-five.

I don't know, where are yours?

I'm not mixed up in anything, hayseed.  What are you talking about?

I see a ring on your finger.  You have any kids?

A weirdo making S+M films?  Who'd have thought it?

Specialty product.

Where does he sell it?

Nothing illegal, it's always borderline.  Like if some freak wants to see a transvestite in a full rubber immersion suit getting an enema from a...

He cuts all kinds of other stuff into his movies; photographs, newsreel footage, subliminal images. Thinks he's making art.

I'm a working stiff, pops.

You want me to come out there and play private eye?

It's their Presidential Suite.

It's cheap, and people know to mind their own business. What have you got for me?

Who is this, in the mask?  Who is he?

What kind of Junior P.I. would I be if I didn't go with you?

I'm trying to figure that out myself.  I have to see Machine without his mask.

Nope.

It's money.  People use it to purchase goods and services.

It's not my money.  The woman I got it from is never going to give it a second thought.  Let's not make a big deal out of this, okay?  Go be a race car driver.  Go run for President.  Whatever.

I try to be.

Apparently Mr. Longdale has something he feels he simply must say before you and I speak.

Thank you.

I'll do whatever I can to help.

I wear a gun when I can tell a client expects me to.  Other than that, there's never any reason.

You hired someone to open it.  I'll bet the lawyer loved that.

Do you want to tell me what you found?

I'm afraid I don't...

Mrs. Christian... please, will you sit down a moment?  I want you to listen carefully. What you're talking about is a "snuff film."  But, from what I know, snuff films are a kind of... urban myth.  Like, red light district folklore.  There's no such thing, I can assure you.

I'm telling you it's not that.

Will you watch it and see for yourself?

I told you I can't, not yet.

No.  For me to live with the ruin of my husband's name, I need know that whoever did this will be punished. If you can find them, I will take their names to the police.  I'll say my husband confessed on his death bed. I'll say I didn't have courage to come forward at first...

Any evidence you collect can be given to the police later, anonymously.  I've thought about it and there's no other way.  If you can't find them... if the only thing that comes from this film is that this is all my husband will be remembered for, well I can't let that happen.  I'm telling you I won't.  If there's no chance that poor girl's memory can be served, then I'll just have to spend my last days trying to forget her.

You've found missing persons before.

I know what I'm asking.  Your compensation will be appropriate to the risk.  You'll need cash to buy information, and I'll provide it.  I feel responsible, Mr. Welles.  You saw what he did to her.

My husband never dealt with money personally, certainly not cash.

The checks were for odd amounts...

You're joking.

For a human life... murder on film, no statute of limitations.  Who knows?  It sure could have.  I'd like you to overnight me a copy of those checks, then put them in a safe deposit box.

Send it to me through the post office like we arranged.  No return address.  You dug this up all by yourself?

I don't know if luck's the word. Are you feeling alright?

I hope it's nothing serious.

I've made progress.  I'm in Manhattan.  Once a few more pieces fall into place, I'll drive to you and give you an update.

Hello, Mrs. Mathews, my name's Thomas Jones, I'm a state licensed investigator...

I don't understand, who are... ?

Neil... Neil Cole.

No.

They hired you.  You're like, a private detective?

You probably expect me to be wearing a trench coat and a hat.  Drinking whiskey, chasing women and getting beaten up by guys with broken noses. Want to know what it's really like? It's sitting in a car and staring at a hotel window for three days straight, pissing in a plastic bottle, pardon me, because some guy thinks his wife's cheating on him. Glamorous, huh?  And the guy who hired you, he has a hair-lip, dandruff and crooked teeth, and you could have told him the minute you laid eyes on him his wife's cheating, and you don't blame her.

No.

Yes.

We were divorced by then.  Things fell apart... he was living with a friend...

It got to be too much for him.

There wasn't anything like that. The police and the FBI people asked, but there wasn't anything happened like that, never.  My husband... his heart broke when Mary left...

No one knows what it's like.  You can't even imagine how much it hurts.

Of course.

We're all like that.

What?

There wasn't one.  The police looked.

I don't know.  I think so.

No.  You don't have any reason to think that...

Will you let me look?

You're probably right, and I probably won't find anything. I don't have a right to ask this, and you can kick me out of your house if you want, but this is my profession and there's a part of me that can't let it go.  Police are just as human as you or I.  They could have missed something.  They probably didn't.  Wouldn't you rather know?

Yes.

It's been six years.

I have to tell you something.  It won't be easy for you to hear.  It's about your daughter... Mary Anne...  When I... when I was there with you, her diary, in your attic, in silverware.  If you read it, you'll know what I'm telling you is true...

Who are you?

No...

No... no... no...

Why... why are you doing this to me... ?

You... you do?  You're sure? Please, Sister, will you take another look, make sure...

I'm trying to find out.  She was a runaway.  I'm looking into it for her parents.

Those are her belongings.

That's her suitcase.  I had forgotten it, till you showed me her picture.

None too discreet, is he?

Excellent.  we accept MasterCard and American Express.

No, you may not.

Yeah, I know the spiel.  If you could bag it, I'll be on my way, thank you.

What?

I don't want to.

But she wouldn't let Dad treat me like that.

Never say can't.  Just do what I do.

What?

Kristen...

It was bad.

It is...was. It's a zapper, it might help me stay awake.

Figure it out?!?!  I'll be insane before I figure it out.  The only thing I'm sure of is that I can't go to sleep.  Not while he's using me.

Have you seen Joey and Kincaid!  God, I can't find them.  I can't find them anywhere.

Yeah, I'm not so sure.

You could do worse.

Sounds like a game show host to me.

Great, you wouldn't happen to know his phone number?

How'd you learn so much about dreams?

I gotta get to the library before it closes.  Killer physics test.

Maybe you shouldn't be working here so much.  You don't want to get stuck waiting tables for the rest of your life.

We have matching luggage.

That obvious, huh?

Saw who? I was up all night cramming for this physics test, and I was putting this little baby together.  Look...

You're his sister, right?

"In her dream"?

Kristen's story really got to her.

Extra money, huh?

The story is, the deaths you can't argue with.

Three days.

Is there something we can do?

Why can't we just talk to the authorities?

Then what else can we do?

Who?

Hey, you're not alone.  We have to stop him, I'm with you.

Cut that shit out.  Maybe before, but not now. I want to help you. I'm on your side.

Something's wrong here.  It feels like...

Save it for later.  Come on!

Alright, I think I see salvation...

Give her time.  Beauty is skin deep.

It was Freddy.

I saw it. It was my dream.  I brought Sheila in...

Earth to Alice...

Excuse me, ladies.  I'll just be a moment.

She told us the story of Freddy.  It's a town legend.  He was a child killer who was freed on a technicality.

It pissed off a lot of parents. According to Kristen, they hunted him down; roasted him alive.

She knew she was gonna die.

How she doing?  I ran into her last night.

About Freddy?

Well Mom, I'll tell ya, when two of your friends die the same day, you let me know what it does to your appetite.

Your distraught.  It'll help...

Sorry!! Sorry that you and your tennis pals torched this guy who's now after me. In case you haven't been keeping score, it's his fucking banquet, and I'm the LAST COURSE!!

When dad's popping aspiring like popcorn, it's avoid-all-contact-day.

Oh God!  He killed them!

I though Freddy was just an old town story.

It's no just a house. It's his home. He's waiting there for me...to dream.

I told you you can't help.  This isn't a normal nightmare. I'm doomed.

Yeah.  I guess so... What happened?

You just stay put.  You need rest.

Don't worry, honey

It's okay, Dan

What I what?  Well, I've thought about it.  I plan to keep him.

What are you talking about?  My "condition"?...

Huh?

It's lonely in there, in my room.

How did you know that?

Been having bad dreams.

No...

She doesn't want me around

My friend, with the funny hand.

Come on downstairs.  He won't hurt you. He needs us both.

He's inside you, where he hides.

It's where he hides out.  Inside.  That's how he found me.

He says it's easy.  Especially with sad people.  With closed-off people.

Jesus!  Don't do that!

They're coach seats, but the plane lands in Paris.  It's gonna be a helluva summer, hon!

Nothing...it's just...I didn't see my father at the ceremony.

No.  Well, not exactly...it's that...I felt like I wasn't in control.  For the first time since...all that.  I'm scared.

Yeah...I guess.

You're right.

I watched from behind the stands.  Didn't want to embarrass you, ya know.  "The drunk showed up", that kind of thing...

It's the model you've been saving up for. I wanted you to have it for your trip.

To take a picture.

Sobering...

Alice...

Since my little girl became a mom...

I've got to go.

But Dad --

Had kind of a long night.

No, the Dan part was nice...

Yeah, before they revoke his diploma.

Alice, it's no dream.  I'm sorry...Dan's dead.

When Dan died you weren't even asleep. You said so.  End of story.

No accident.  I tried to warn all of you about Krueger.

Why don't you two stick to reality.

I think Krueger's trying to do something to it.

Mark knows I'm not crazy.  Ask him to show you his hands.

I just can't figure out how he's getting in when I'm awake...

Krueger is reality.

What do you think I'm doing?  Look.  Whether you believe it or not, Krueger is back.  He's after the baby and if I don't try to do something about it, who will??

Goddamn it, Yvonne!  You don't just run away from this guy!  He finds you in your dreams.

That's the only reason you're alive...

If they actually bothered to bury her.

Jacob.  We've got to get to Amanda before it's too late.

We've got to go to the asylum and find her body.  Mark said her soul's trapped with it -- that's why she can't come to me.  It must be!

So did Dan.

I think I'm starting to wear her down.  Have some anyway.

Greta, come on.  One burger with me?

That's why it's my fault Dan's dead.

I'm very fucking sorry, but Greta is dead today.  Could we interest you in someone else?

She must've fallen asleep at the table...

Mark!

Nobody thinks that.

It wasn't her mother.  The only reason we're still here is that none of us has slept since the grad party.

Why don't I go make some coffee.  There's a lot to tell.

My baby!

I don't know!

I'm going to see what else I can find out about Mr. Fred Krueger

Then we'll find another way.

That's their problem.

That's what the newspapers thought.  She spent the rest of her life in the asylum. After Krueger's trial she flipped out and hung herself, so they thought.

But I've seen her grave.

No shit.

She killed herself.  Her soul's gonna be in torment.

Next life.  Oh, what's that?

You know my mother -- get real.  What about Alice's?

Who?

I don't believe this... All that gore you paint in the comics and you're squeamish?

Makes you look like a nun--

Yeah...

I want to talk about the baby.

Two hours a day, six days a week.

Faint.

Mark...

I can't listen to this.

Stick around, please?

He invited me to his house last night.

It was supposed to be.  Dad had a heart attack, two days ago.

Not in two days.  Look:  Do you think I <u>wanted</u> to come?  If it didn't mean so much to Dad - proving his depth-explorer - it's the last thing I'd want!

Your 'out.'  This came for you. 

Dead?  Matter of fact, he's much better. He's left the hospital.

Your father can be in Nome, Alaska, tomorrow.  We have two choices: Ask them to send him out in a 'copter', and take you off, or the Shark can put back into Nome...

We're <u>all</u> risking our lives!

You're really a mixed-up oddball, aren't you?

You mean <u>nothing</u> is worth fighting for?

You may not <u>win</u> them.  But without men like your father, to 'degrade' himself by fighting to preserve them - or as much as we have of them - they'd have disappeared, <u>long</u> ago!

- any more than being the son of Captain Neilsen does!

I'd sooner swim!

Yes?

But if they <u>do</u>?

I wouldn't worry.  So long as we have boats like the Tiger Shark - and people like you, the Skipper, Dave, Kent, Sir Ian and my father -

So they caught up with you, too?

Disappointing a <u>big</u> girl!

Huh?

I guess.

So?

Have you ever talked to Carl - tried to see his side?

'Us?'

Not <u>alone</u>, you're not!

What's more important - there's our problem.  The bow ram - the sawteeth are holding the Shark in the break. If we can cut the ram, the Shark can pull herself loose!

Go back and tell Dr. Neilsen. Have him report to the Skipper.

Strange you didn't hear it. OMIT 274F

You know - it <u>is</u>?

Let's get back to work, and maybe we <u>will</u> be, soon.

Somewhere down there?

I'm with <u>you!</u>

Oh it does???

Right, Skipper.

Seems to be all around...

I...don't know!

Speed...about twenty-two knots. Course...due north!

Right at our one-eyed friend!

Sidearms?  But the saucer's dead.

Something wrong?

Why do you say that?

What????

Wonderful!

Radiation level...constantly rising...

What about time...?

Under <u>water</u>?

Suppose our theorizing is correct? Then this <u>could</u> be the next danger point!

If we were lucky enough to catch him with his power depleted....

There's got to be an explanation!

As ready as we <u>can</u> be!  I'll report to the Skipper.

I did go.  Just back.  Reef, these are a couple of our passengers - Sir Ian Hunt, and Dr. Clifford Kent.  My exec, Commander Richard Holloway.

Who with?

Huh?

I think I should have joined the Air Force!

After torpedo room:  Report!

Take a look.

Thirty-four seconds!

That's what I said!

We can <u>ram</u> him!

It's the screws, Skipper.  At our declination angle, running in reverse, they're pulling the Shark <u>and</u> Cyclops right to the bottom.

What?

Come where?

Point of view is everything. To us, <u>your</u> form of life is ugly as we appear to you.

- for horrors like yourself?

Your friend was to remain where he was!

I am afraid not.  Therefore -

On the contrary.  I want you - unharmed - perfect.

That's why no water leaked inside when we rammed you?

Obviously.

Thank you.

The pattern.  Each incident occurred almost precisely a thousand statute miles from the Pole.  A line through the points of occurrence makes almost a complete circle...

Our 'Cyclops' throws quite a thunderbolt, itself!

Or, perhaps, until he gets us?

But <u>answers</u> are what we need - not more questions!

Toward the Pole!

Yeah, sure. Why? I got this damned tooth, I got a few things bugging me, like everybody else. But I'm okay.

Alma, I think there's some dirty business going on in this town.

This is maybe worse than you and I are used to.  What I'm talking about, I'm talking about murder. Among other things.

Evan Twombley, the union boss who got shot. Somebody murdered him.

You know Jack Hewitt, the kid I work with?

Sometimes things are simpler than you think. Let me ask you a question.

About Jack? No. Have you checked out the tax bill on your father's farm lately?

What is the Northcountry Development Association?

He musta found out. They had to get rid of him. And Jack'll get blamed.

Just tell me when you'll have it fixed.

Yeah. I know about that.

He can't fire me. LaRiviere already did that this morning.

It would help if you were married, if there was someone at home while you work.

How soon?

Good. It would help if there were some drug or alcohol abuse on the part of your ex-wife. Sexual problems upsetting to the child.

No, not exactly. I'll look at the divorce decree, see if we can get it redrawn. Interview your daughter. Jill, right?

Fine. I'll need a $500 retainer. You can mail it.

Hard to say. If we go for custody, depositions, psychiatric evaluations, it could drag on. Ten or twelve thousand dollars. She could win on appeal. If we just want to get the visitation rights redrawn, assuming they're unduly restrictive, it wouldn't be more than twenty-five hundred.

You might be better off legally as well as financially to just go for the --

I hear Twombley got shot.

Nope. Heard it. We wasn't far apart. I spotted this buck, then I heard the gun go off and Twombley was gone. I looked over the little cliff we was using for a stand and there the fucker was, deader'n shit. Called it right in.

Not exactly. I mean, he never paid me.

Lawyer? I don't need no lawyer, do I?

Shit! What are we gonna do?

That was me.

Don't worry, Mr. Twombley, I know where those suckers are. Rain or shine, snow or no snow. I know deer. We'll kill us a buck today. Guaranteed. Before ten.

Yep. Right about now the does are holing up in the brush piles. The bucks are right behind them and we're right behind the bucks.  This gun gets fired before ten o'clock. Whether it kills a deer or not is more less up to you. I'll put you inside 30, 35 yards of a buck the first four hours of the season. That's what you're paying me for, ain't it?

Tell you what. You get me close to a big buck by ten, kid, there's another hundred bucks in it.

Yeah.

You take care of your end, kid, I'll take care of mine.

You understand what I'm saying? I want a deer, a dead one, not a cripple or whatthefuck.

And you'll get your extra hundred bucks.

Follow close. We'll cross the next meadow.

Yeah?

You played for the Sox?

Oh.

Really.

Hmm.

What happened?

Yeah.

Sun's gettin high.

You only got a little while if you want your hundred bucks.

Evan. He's a mucky-muck union official from Massachusetts. You're lucky.

How'd you get the job?

Right. The sonofabitch couldn't get along without me.

Shit.

Piece of fucking cake.

In the chest.

The ambulance guys lugged him up.

Yeah.

Musta... How'd I know? What're you doing, playing cop?

Who the fuck knows? Musta slipped or something. I just heard the gun go off.

Well, I didn't actually see him do it. Like I said.

What?

He sure as hell won't.

Lawford?

Why don't you quit now, you want out so bad?

I mean it -- you got enough money now. Head out for California. Surf's up, Jack, and you're digging wells in the snow.

Who's fault is it then if it's not yours? You're the one in charge, Daddy.

Look. Those kids are still trick-or- treating. They're still out.

Do what?

I guess they're stupid.

Well, yeah. Sort of. Nothing really mean. Me and my pals, me and my brothers. It was kind of funny then. Stealing pumpkins, soaping windows. Stuff like that.

It's not funny now. I'm a cop and I gotta listen to all the complaints people make. I'm not a kid anymore. You change.

What are you talking about?

No. I didn't used to be bad. No sir. Where do you get this stuff? From your mother?

It's not that.

It's stupid.

I want to go home.  I don't like it here.

No.

I don't want to be here. Don't worry, I love you, Daddy, I do. But I want to go home.

I called Mommy.

Yes.

I... because I want to go home. She said she'd come and get me.

See, I knew you'd be mad.

I told her I wanted to come home. Daddy, don't be mad at me.

Yes.

Yes.

That's fine with me too. When Mommy comes, tell her I'm up here.

I'm glad you're here. Can you stay for a while?

Yeah. My car's in the shop. This'll be fine.

It belongs to Pop.

Grandpa. My father. It's his.

Mommy won't let me eat fast food. You know that. It's bad for you.

Nothing.

Same thing, Daddy. Mommy says --

Okay. So we'll get what you want. What do you want?

Okay.

What are you sorry for?

I know.

Nope. Not anymore. I'm nothing anymore.

I want to go home.

Got here just in time. Go ahead. Jump in line. Maybe you'll win a prize.

Watch this snow. It's coming down tonight.

His son-in-law damn near killed me.

At the school crossing. In his BMW. Coulda hurt some kids. I'm gonna bust his ass.

I'm not saying that.

A hunting accident. Jack and Twombley.

I figured you already heard.

Twombley's shot. I heard that. Not Jack. He's okay, I assume.

You mean Twombley?

You ain't the hunter Jack is. And he can't drive the grader worth shit.

You want me to follow them to Littleton?

Yeah. A few things.

I'm fine, fine.

You ever think of getting a new car, Wade?

Elaine! Call Chub Meritt and have him pick up Wade's car, fix the clutch.

Nothing, Wade, I've been thinking. You don't get enough appreciation around here and it's time we changed things a little.

Wade, that wasn't smart. Going out right after the man's father-in-law shot himself. Let it go. Call it a favor to me.

Mel's doing some business with me. It's nice to do favors for people you do business with. He was in a hurry. No big deal.

What's the difference? Take my truck, take a rest -- stop worrying about Mel Gordon. Have you decided what to do with your old man's place -- he going to stay there?

Maybe.

Could be.

Where is she now? Is she in the truck with your friends?

Oh, Jesus, lay off, will you? It looks like you've won this fucking round already, so lay off a little, for Christ's sake.

No, not anymore. It's too... it's too far.

We've done all our talking, Wade.

Hi honey.

You make me sick. I can't believe you've sunk so low.

Did you see that sonofabitch in the BMW? He could've killed somebody.

I know who it is.

Mel Gordon.

From Boston. Evan Twombley's son-in- law -- he was driving. I know where they're headed. Up the lake, Agaway. The old man's out deer hunting with Jack Hewitt, so they probably got some big weekend party planned.

For a while.

Okay. She's fine.

See you tomorrow, maybe.

Yeah.

Yeah.

I'm going to start one of those custody suits. I don't give a fucking shit. You know?

Yeah. I mean that.

The hell she isn't. Lillian's been trying to nail me to a cross since the day I met her. I'm gonna hire me a fucking lawyer from Concord and get this thing, this divorce thing, rearranged. I've been thinking about it a lot. It's like she owns Jill or something. Nobody owns nobody, especially not kids. And I pay her.

Tonight. Let's get together.

There's something funny about that shooting. There's lots funny about it, actually.

I'm sure, I'm positive it didn't happen the way Jack says it did.

I've been wondering if maybe Jack shot Twombley, instead of Twombley shooting himself. I've been wondering maybe Jack shot him on purpose.

Jack doesn't need money.

Jack wouldn't kill for it. Besides, who would pay him?

You wouldn't have done anything like that, shot someone for money.

But not now.

You knew me as a kid.

I'm her father -- supposed to be, but I'm not able to. Yes. Yes, I am. It may be the only thing in my life I've been so clear about wanting. Even if it takes a big fight.

I've been thinking about it, that's all.

It was to the same woman. I was just a kid...  It's not like a marriage proposal or anything, just a thought. Something for you and me to talk about and think about. You know?

Good.

Don't you think it's proper for a fella to introduce his girl to his parents?

I just want to pick up my divorce papers. For the lawyer. It won't take long.

The truck's here. Looks like they've stayed inside since the snow started.

Think they're alright?

How?

It's my tooth! My fucking tooth! I can't even think anymore because of it.

Look, that's temporary, believe me. There's so much shit gonna hit the fan the next few days, my getting fired by LaRiviere and Merritt won't matter a bit.

I'm just cleaning out some of this stuff that's built up. For the rummage sale. And some things for the cleaners. And the laundromat.

Don't be silly. Hi, Jill.

There's a furnace.

It's broke I guess. There's an electric in the bedroom.

When did she die?

Can --?

How's that?

Jesus Christ. Mr. Gordon, when I come all the way to serve somebody a summons, I don't call ahead for an appointment.

Yesterday morning, you passed a stopped school bus, which was flashing its lights, then you--

Don't give me a hard time, Mr. Gordon. I'm just --

Yes. Here's your ticket.

I was... I'm Wade Whitehouse. I was wondering, is your husband here?

Well, yes, I'm... I want to say that I'm real sorry about your father, Mrs. Twombley.

Oh, no. No, it's a... it's a traffic thing. No big deal.

You be careful of that little bastard. He's dying to get in your pants, you know.

Fuck. Wade Whitehouse. It's people like you that keep this fucking town from prospering. Whatever somebody does to improve things around here, you gotta find fault with it.

This town sucks.

That goddamned woman. Thinks she can cart Jill off and leave me alone like this. I'm more than pissed, Margie. I'm a whole lot more than pissed. I been that plenty and I know the difference. This is different.

Not since last night. He took a guy hunting.

Jack?

Where... how'd you hear that?

No, I... I've been out on the grader all morning. Twombley's summer people. Massachusetts. Friend of Gordon's. It was his idea for Jack to take him hunting.  I gotta go.

It's called a grilled cheese sandwich, you dub.

Atta-go.

Sleeping.

From Wickham's. Been a while. Like some coffee?

We're alright. Your Ma's sleeping. You want me to get her?

She's coming.

I checked on her. She had the electric heater. Cold don't bother her as much as me. Which is why I give her the heater.

Wade. I thought she was alright. Till this morning she was.

Come on, smart guy. Tell how it's no big deal. Tell me how a single one of you is worth a single hair on that woman's head.

You don't know me. You don't know me!  So fuck you. Fuck you.

Love! I'm made of love!

Everything you know is from me.

Bang!

Crawl!

I don't know you. My goddamn father and I don't know you.

Wade?

There was something. It happened up your way.

Wade, it's late. I know you're probably at Toby's, but I'm in bed reading. We got different habits.

He was scheduled to testify for a committee investigating organized crime in New England and the construction business.

You think Jack shot him?

They were out deer hunting, right? Jack probably heard the gun go off, then came back and found the body.

Huh?

How was she?

Who?

What happened?

Yeah, I guess.

I get to feeling like a whipped dog some days, Rolfe, and some night I'm going to bite back. I swear it.

No, no, I haven't. Not really. I've growled a little, but I haven't bit.

What about Jill? Is Lillian bringing her?

Yeah. She'll probably quit her job and stay out here with Pop. We can't leave him alone here, he'll set the damn place on fire. With Jill here a lot, it'll be good to have Margie around. Things are going to change in that department, by the way. I got a custody lawyer in Concord. I'm gonna see him tomorrow. All hell's gonna break loose, but it's worth it.

Anything new about the shooting? Twombley?

Want to know what I think happened?

I think your first response to the Twombley shooting was the correct one.

That it wasn't an accident.

Well, your friend, I think. Jack Hewitt.

Money.

They wouldn't deal with a guy like Jack. Who else benefits if Twombley is suddenly dead?

Okay. It's likely there are people in the union who don't want Twombley to testify. They probably include his son-in-law who's vice-president and will probably be the next president. I read that in the papers. What's his name, Mel Gordon?

Here's my theory. Twombley, unaware of illegal union loans or whatever, starts nosing around cause of the investigation and finds out. Finds out his son-in-law is involved.

A hunting accident is perfect.

Not particularly.

I care about what happened. The truth. I'm a student of history, remember?

Yeah.

Of course it happened. Why would I lie about it?

You think I wouldn't remember a thing like that?

We'd have to go digging in Vietnam to ask him.

Well, I never heard that one.

That's what you think.

Wade, are you alright?

Take care of the little things first, the things that are distracting you from taking care of the big things. Call Chub Merritt, get your car back, call a dentist, for God's sake, and get your tooth pulled, don't trust the locals, get your facts straight and go straight to the state police. Let them work on this.

Alice...

You're jet-lagged.  We'll talk about this back...

Your father never means to be so...

Yes dear?

Jim... for godsake!

So, you study world events, little one. That's good for a girl your age.

That's the way of the world, little one. Didn't they teach you that in school?

It would be a pity to squander such a strong personality.

You are a resilient man, Mr.

Hey, you guys back already?

It was the experience of a lifetime.

Daddy...

Alice... I...

Been better, Dad... You?

It's okay, honey. I got you. I got you. You're okay.

Okay, I'm slowing us down.

Did we warn them off?

They are in our airspace. We would be within our rights.

Warn then again. If they don't respond... shoot them down. We will not be intimidated.

Okay, it's on. We've got some indicator lights here.

cross it...  The static overwhelms the voice, then cuts out.

You read my mind.

He's busy being dead.

I'm doing what I can.

Okay. We're gonna arc a fat one to the right. Got it?

We still got three MiGs running around and six more on the way.

Just stay on my wing, sir. I'll take you all the way in.

Lemme take a look.

Sluggish... I think it's jammed too.

This doesn't make sense.

I prefered the terrorists.

Goddamn right I did.  I asked for a tough-as-nails speech and you gave me diplomatic bullshit.  What's the point in having a speech if I have to ad-lib?

Thanks.  Wrote it last night.

Put together a score sheet.  I'll make some calls.

An exercise in futility. Send the Nimitz back in.

Does your office have anything to add, Mr. Dean?

I hate to be pragmatic, but they'll sacrifice pawns before kings. It may take them some time to kill their way up to senior staff.

Like any good poker player, they're checking over their hand seeing which cards to play and which to discard.

To swear you in as President.

Yes, Mr. President.

Because it is my duty.

My loyalty was never to my country.

About goddamn time.

Air Force One, acknowledged.  tNT. EMERGENCY PARACHUTE LAUNCH RAMP.

Roger.

Ga get it.

Sir, this plane carries the President of the United States.

Dead.

We checked the manifest. Everyone was accounted for.

Well it worked.

Avionics compartment! It's the only place. You better get Zedeck down there fast Unless, of course, you'd rather be a martyr than a savior.

We're not going to make it.

Where are we now?

No! If we land this plane anywhere else, we will end up another Entebe.  The Americans built a super plane that flies through mushroom cloud, evades missiles and...  refuels in mid-air. Call the White House.

Romeo Tango Zulu, copy One the television, graphics of the First Family against the Presidential Seal.

Stand by.

Copy, Air Force One.

This is a remarkable aircraft.

A dubious distinction, no?

Conference rooms, though some have other functions.  The one up front doubles as an emergency medical center.

Thank you.

How are your fellow hostages feeling, Ms. Mitchell?

Very good. Thank you, Ms. Mitchell.

Come on, Alice.

Or you will do what, Mrs. Marshall?  But I admire your courage. Your husband, on the other hand...

I know he left you behind.

Your husband is a coward. He sends soldiers half-way around the world to steal a man from his home in the middle of the night.

Yes

I neither enjoy nor dislike. I do what is necessary.

No.

You will be the first to pay for that mistake.

Please. You can kill me but leave my daughter alone.

Jim...

You're very valuable. And our nation needs so many things.

Call up Petrov and order Stravanavitch' S release.

Pity. Mr. Gibbs.

You'll do it?

Good. Good.

One thing I've learned as

Let my daughter go or I'll take you out!

Hold on, Alice.

You heard me.  You. Congress and cabinet heads.

Yes. You've made yourself quite clear.

I'm sure we can strike some sort of arrangement. Land the plane and we'll trade you hostages for fuel.

Tell our boys to cool their jets. I don't need `em creating policy for me.

Gravity.

Eighteen thousand feet, sir. And two hundred knots... otherwise it's suicide.

Yes, sir.

That isn't necessary.

Can't it wait?

Rose, I don't have time for this.

But that's the point, Jim. We're right here.

Shall I ask the Chief of Staff to schedule your daughter in?

Please... don't start with me.

Both of you.

No good. I said they disabled the communications system.

White House Situation room.

Actually, sir, you could be that someone.

They're still alive, but the loyalists plan to start killing hostages in forty minutes.

You know my policy. We don't negotiate with terrorists. If we start now, all of America becomes a target.

Freeing Stravanavitch is gonna get tens of thousands killed. I can't live with that.  I'm not royalty. I'm an elected official and the integrity of the office of the President is infinitely more important than the man who holds that office.  We don't negotitate. Not as long as I'm President. Is that understood?

We're under attack.

We're handling it, sir.

Okay listen, listen carefully. This is an emergency call from Air Force One. Who's there? Is the Vice- President there?

You don't understand. This is an emergency. Let me talk to anyone.

No. no. no. Wait. Wait.

I always wondered if my freshman Russian class would come in handy.

No, no.  I'm fine.  What did the Speaker say?

I might still have a few chips left.

This is a crime bill, Shep.  Killing a couple ducks won't get it through committee.  Besides, Shep, I told you...  I don't shoot babies and I don't kiss guns.

Right... Christ I'm tired.  Do me a favor and keep me away from the press.

Sir, the Speaker of the House attacked this administration on national television.  You can't afford to leave that hanging.

I never left. Where's my wife and daughter?

Sir...

A MiG? Where the hell are we?

Iraq? Shep, you're fired.

How long's it been since you flew, sir?

They better. Fuel's almost gone.

We're hooked. Hove into position.

Forget it.  The boys on the board want that shuttle to go on schedule.

Bud, get wise to the political realities. The boys on the board are under a lot of pressure from the boys downtown.

That just doesn't make any sense.

I told you, leave the boys in Washington to the boys downtown and the boys down...

Some southern plantation owner falls in love with this poor...

Commissioner, Aquarius.

Yes I did...

Yes it did.  Mr. Dunn, can I ask you a personal question?

Um...  Do you people scream right when you... you know.

Dunn.

Accelerators down.

You better check it, Unger.

You better check on it, Mr. Dunn.  I'll stay here and fly the ship.

Sir?

But, Ted, the invitations have already gone out.

There's nothing wrong with me!

You're as bad as the rest of them, Elaine!  It's all here in the design specifications!  Look!  It's all here!

Who's that, Ted?

And when are you going to realize, Ted, that your mental hygiene is the most important thing right now.

Ted, you must remember what the doctor said, the first step on the road to sanity is admitting that you're sick.  Now take your electro-shock and you'll be back at the space center in no time.  And by the way, Ted, I'm leaving you for Simon.

If that's the way you want it.

Goodbye, Ted.  I don't want to hurt you.

I have to get in there.  I have to stop this flight.

Let me by, Elaine.

I've got it, Elaine!  I've figured out what's wrong with the shuttle!

Not now, Elaine!

Ted.  I don't know why you got on this flight.  I don't know what you're trying to prove.

We can't go back.  We had something very special, but it's all over.

What would you say if I told you the toilet just blew up in my face.

There's something dangerously wrong with this ship, Elaine.  I know its the wiring. That toilet's just the tip of the iceberg.

Ted, there's no time to explain.

Ted, please be careful.

Not now, Elaine.

That was very well put, Ted.

I just want you to know, I love you Ted and always will.

Sit down, Elaine.  If this bomb trick works we just might make it.  Simon was a fool to eject now.

That's right -- premature ejection.

The sun will heat that thing to over 450 degrees within seconds.  He'll roast like a pig on a spit.

Not when I'm with you, Ted.

Set!

Kramer, the WORP control handle just came off in my hand.

What can <u>I</u> do, Doctor Rumack?

I mean for Ted.

Is that a good sign, Doctor?

Is he making any progress, Doctor?

Simon.

Simon, why has he become so... so...

Don't be too long.

I think so.

Roger.

He tried to disconnect ROK.  It gassed him.  That computer is running this ship and we're heading right for the sun.

We're computer locked and the manual navigation unit is down.

Your career!  What about the lives of those people out there.  Simon, what happened to the man I thought I loved?

Yes, sir.

I see.  What do you think our alternatives are?

You can do it from up here, Captain.

Negative.

Negative.

That's okay, ROK.

Go ahead.

Systems check positive.  Look, Elaine, I...

Life support check.  Elaine, it's obvious you've been ignoring me.  You're a woman. I can relate to that.

There's nothing wrong with me, Elaine. What about tonight -- just you and me.  We can be alone.  I can get rid of everyone else on the ship -- I've already proven <u>that</u>.

I bet Scraps is going to love Mercury.

It's going to be terrific.  A whole new world, new kids to play with.

No more kids yelling, 'Your old man's a thieving rapist'?

Scraps.

Sure.

Yeah.

We've spent everything on these operations.  Is it really worth it?  We've pawned your mother's wedding ring.  The kids have no winter clothes...

All right.  Here.

I don't want to live anymore.

You're sure?

How would you like your eggs, Captain? Over.

Poached <u>and</u> over, Captain Oveur?  Over.

All right, Captain Oveur.  Over.

Have you tried it with a little cinnamon?

Sixteen 'C', why?

A b...

What should I say?

Mr. Kurtz, I presume.

Captain Oveur, your navigator, Mr. Unger, and your first officer, Mr. Dunn.

Yes, sir, commander.  This is Mercury One.  Everything seems A- okay up here and ready for count-down.

Thanks, but we have a terrific woman in on Thursdays.

Let's go, Daddy.  We have to check in.  He was never appreciated at the Institute.

Now he's D-Y-I-N-Ging and wants to be buried on Mercury.

You'll have to be more specific than that, sir.

Death, death.  How about the first Thursday in March, ten o'clock.

That's right, Striker.  And we're getting married when we return.

Look at this wiring.  It's shorting out under high temperatures.

I know you've been subtly spreading the word that I'm having a breakdown.

Kurtz, you're drunk.  Who's in command of this ship?

Then Elaine was right.

Pull yourself together!  We've got to...

Uh... oh, thank you.  It's nothing.

Not Dr. Barrington, the world renowned agronomist?

I'm familiar with your work, Doctor. You'll have to excuse me, I have to go.

I'm getting over it.  If a relationship isn't working, you can't force it.

I opened this panel and a vacuum cleaner hit me.

We were in love but I'm not sure I know what love is anymore.

Sure.  But that's only when the love itself goes unchanged.

I just wish it was that simple.  We really were in love.  You know how it is when you laugh all the time.

Well, we laughed.  We laughed all the time.

That's very nice of you. Thank you.

Thank you. Cream?

Were you vacationing in Los Angeles?

No. I'm from Washington, D.C. I'm a lobbyist for the Small Businessmen's Assocation.

Well, I'm afraid that's a question that's all too easy to answer.

I wish I could fool myself into believing that that's the reason. The truth of the matter is, nobody ever asked me.

Mine's Eleanor. Eleanor Schiff.

No. I'm all alone.

That's a very nice compliment, and I'd like to say that...you've done the same for me.

Oh, yes. Come in, Paul. Rex will be right out.

Well, to tell the truth, they really didn't fill me in on many of the details. Just told me to pick up Captain Kramer.

Shep, no! I'll bet you have exciting things happen all the time down there.

I <u>am</u> serious, and don't call me Shirley! What flying experience have you had?

Let's see. Those are the flaps, that's the thrust, this must turn on the landing lights.

Chicago, the passengers are beginning to panic. When do we start down?

Yes, everything they've got. How are the passengers doing?

Surely there must be something you can do.

And the last thing he said to me, "Doc," he said, "Sometime when the crew is up against it and the breaks are beating the boys, tell them to go out there with all they've got and win just one for the Zipper. I don't know where I'll be then, Doc," he said, "but I won't smell too good. That's for sure."

I can't tell.

Well...not for another two hours.

No, I mean we can't <u>land</u> for another two hours. Fog has closed down everything this side of the mountains. We've got to go through to Chicago!

That's right.

Yes. Yes, of course.

Certainly.

Well, we had a choice. Steak or fish.

He had fish.

Let's see now. The co-pilot had fish. What did the navigator eat?

Extremely serious. It starts with a slight fever.

I think you ought to know what our chances are. The life of everyone on board depends on just one thing: finding someone back there who not only can fly this plane, but who didn't have fish for dinner.

Ted!

I just don't want to go over it any more.

I have been patient and I've tried to help, but you wouldn't even let me do that.

It takes so many things to make love last. Most of all it takes respect. And I can't live with a man I don't respect!

I won't be back. I've requested the Atlanta run.

Then why don't you take the job that Louie Netz offered you at Boeing?

Your <u>war</u> <u>record</u>? You're the only one keeping that alive. For everyone else it's ancient history.

But if you'll just give me...

Elaine, I've got to talk to you.

My orders came through. My squadron ships out tomorrow. I'll be leading a very important mission.

I love you, Elaine.

I remember everything. All I have are memories.

Headquarters!? What is it?

Seven. Lieutenant Zipp died this morning. Ted, Doctor Sandler says you'll be out in a week. Isn't that wonderful?

Be patient, Ted. No one expects you to get over this immediately.

That's Lieutennt Hurwitz. Severe shell shock. He thinks he's Ethel Merman.

That's what I've been trying to tell these people.

And a little ice.

Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.

It's a damn good thing you don't know how much he hates your guts.

What happened, Ted? What went wrong?

I don't care. I just don't have what it takes. They'd be better off with someone who'd never flown before.

Yes?

Tell them the gear is down and we're ready to land.

Uh-huh.

Hello.

Joey can stay up here for a while if he'd like to.

Who wants to be first?

I think so, but I've never seen it so acute.

You promise you'll write.

Good-bye, darling. I love you. I love you, darling.

Yes, Captain?

Runway niner. It's the longest, and directly into the wind.

You are now eight miles from the airport. Turn right to a heading of zero eight niner, throttle back slightly and begin to lose altitude to fifteen hundred feet.

Watch your altitude, Striker. It's too erratic. You can't come straight in. You've got enough fuel left for two hours flying. You've got to stay up there 'til we get a break in the weather.

All right, he's on final now! Put out all runway lights except niner.

Yeah, I think he is.  Hey, Fred!

What is it?

Oh Jack, I'm so warm. I'm burning up.

I'm sorry, son, but you must have me confused with someone else. My name is Roger Murdock. I'm the co-pilot.

I think you should go back to your seat now, Joey. Right, Clarence?

I think you're the greatest. But my Dad says you don't work hard enough on defense.

...and that lots of times you don't even run down court.

...and that you don't really try, except during the playoffs.

I'm Randy.

I thought maybe you'd like to hear a song.

Okay, this is one of my favorites.

I will, but Jim won't.

Yes, of course. We both had fish. Why?

Huh?

Huh?

Roger, Roger. What's our vector, Victor?

No, why don't you take care ot it?

Yes?

Of course.

No. No thank you.

The cockpit? What is it?

Would you go up, please?

Thank you, Randy. You better leave sweetheart. You might get hurt in here.

Does that cost extra or you throw them in?

The girl out front mentioned Strader's assistant, somebody named Watson.  Maybe he knows.

Not unless I got real drunk and nobody told me about it later.

I think you're just a little scared now, about what you might find once the lights go out.  A little scared... and a lot curious.  Maybe more than you want to admit.  But doesn't that turn you on, that curiosity and fear, swirling together?  Think of it as broadening your horizons.

Your voice is saying no, but your body is saying yes.

Yeah...

Ss'ai k'ss?  Perfect.

The young woman at the front said you might know where he is.

Show me.

Jesus, Sykes -- it's been less than ten hours.  Me and Alterez are on it, okay?

Lay off, asshole.

You were partners with him on some Slag -- uh, Newcomer real estate thing.

No, Sergeant -- not history...  Eternity...

It is his new partner that I'm worried about.

Here?

Sergeant... I'd like to thank you for what you're doing.

I am George.

My true name is Ss'tangya T'ssorentsa'.

That is exactly so.  It is like your name... Sykes.  I'm sure it doesn't bother you at all that it sounds like "ss'ai k'ss", two words in my language which mean "excrement" and "cranium".

There was no wallet... but he was still wearing a watch and two rings.

The murder at the mini-mart is not our case.  The Captain said--

Yes.

Nothing's wrong.  I just want to get something straight.  You agree that there's a good chance these two shootings are somehow related, right?

Possibly.  Good.  Well, would you be willing to accept the theory, George, that... possibly... by examining the evidence from one case we might shed some small ray of light on the other?  Does that sound unreasonable to you?

Great.  Well, I'm sure glad that's settled, aren't you?

Nothing.

Shouldn't we examine their personal effects?

A rubber.  A condom.  You know... Coney Island whitefish?  Men, human men, put them on their, uh -- penises -- to protect against having babies.  You need this for anything?

And still it fits?

So the Slag they're cutting into upstairs worked at a refinery just like Hubley worked at a refinery.  I'd say that "possible" connection between the two cases just got a hell of a lot more possible.  Okay, next step -- I gotta go talk to the wife of the Slag store owner blown away last night.

Why the hell--?!  Great, fine.  You talk to the wife.

Did you learn anything?

Aw-right.  What about the other guy?

Did you talk to him?

Why'd I do what?

My partner is dead!  Because one of you bastards killed him -- then disappeared into a rathole down in Slagtown, where he's home and dry, 'cause nobody sees nothing, nobody says nothing...

At the end of the bar.

Uh, Matthew...

But I-- .

Your mother mates out of season.

From quarantine, when my people first arrived here.  He and I were housed together.

In the camps, we were lodged four to a room.  The selection process was entirely random.  We did not get to stay with our friends... or families...

Yeah, sure.  I knew that...

Three months.  We learn quickly.  We adapt.  It is our strength... what we were bred for, to adapt to hostile environments.

This is mole.  It's good.

Ss'loka'.  It means literally "small but intelligent creature".  It loses much in the translation.

Ss'trokya ss'lato 'na'.

Through his ass.  Next time you see him, tell him to call me... unless you want us to keep coming back on you like a bad case of herpes.

You are married?

We mate for life.  Divorce... is a strange concept to us.

I appreciate your honesty, George.

Maybe not... I don't know.  I'm not sure I'm gonna go.  She doesn't need her burn-out of a father there...

In the other man's rectum.

Ta ss'trakyona'...

No shit, Holmes.  You're only from another goddamn planet, for chrissakes.

Don't count on me, George.  I never had any ideals.

A man, a human, was wiring it to your car.  I didn't get a good look at him.  I must call my wife...

George, she's not gonna divorce you. You mate for life, remember?

Why?

Come on, you won't have to get near the water.

Thank you.

Nothing.

No.  I cannot involve you.  This is not your concern.

... It is called ss'jabroka'.  To us it is a potent narcotic.

Like your cocaine, I suppose.  The "high" lasts several hours.  We would receive small amounts of it... as a reward for our labor.

Your people don't know about this part of out past.  And they can't know -- It would threaten our entire existence here.

Stay out of this, Matthew.  Tell me where the drug has been taken or I will crush your lungs against this wall.

The fifty kilos, Matthew.  I have to find it.  I can't let it get out on the street.

Fuck procedure.

Ss-ai!

There!  Go back.  Down that side street.

Do what?!  George-- ?!

... It's Harcourt.

No he's not.  Not if he overdosed on the drug.  Massive amounts trigger a... a change.  Your body functions seize up, you appear to be dead, but it's really a state of incubation.  When you emerge you're...

We can't let him get away.

You understand that.  But how many others will?

You look very good.

Only holds five.

Well, one of the men didn't like him so much...

Who else can I ask around here?

I think you're gonna find he's taken the rest of his life off.

Yes it is.  Thirty-five percent pure Methane gas in there.  I don't know how these fellas do it.

... They took the stuff out, all of it -- this afternoon.

Try Joshua Strader, will ya, darlin'?

Yeah -- we met him.  Wonderful boy... close personal friend of George's here.

Ss'kya'ta'.

Yeah... I seen him around.  High- roller dude named Strader.  Joshua Strader.  Runs a club on the west side.  Encounters.

That's all I know.  You want anything more, you ask somebody else.

Come on.  You got nothin' better to do, cushy county job like yours.

Fedorchuk couldn't find his ass with his hands in his back pockets.

Yeah.

Lucky nothing.  I had to empty my damn gun into him.

Yeah, I'll bet.

Looking for some foreign compound in the blood of that alien you dropped the other day.

Captain.  I'd like to volunteer for duty with the new detective.

Departmental policy.

Granger and Pitts have one hell of a caseload... and I would have thought with Jetson here being the first Newcomer plainclothes, and Hubley's body being found over in the Newcomer community...

It is. 

Hey, look -- we've known Kristin since... since she was conceived in that cabin up in Big Bear. Remember?  You and Edie banged the wall so hard, me and Carol were picking plaster out of our hair for a week...

But you're bummed because your ex and her new husband are paying for the whole thing.

Whatever gave you that idea?

Of course.  Right in the trunk of the car.

I got him.  Don't get pinned.

I can't!  Do you mind!

Christ.  I never saw such a buncha old women.  You want me to fetch your slippers, Hudson?

Let's go...let's go.  Cycle through!

Rescue mission.  There's some juicy colonists' daughters we gotta rescue from virginity.

Talk to me, Hudson.

Awright.  Fire-team A.  Gear up. Let's move.  Two minutes. Somebody wake up Hicks.

Ten seconds, people.  Look sharp!

Now let me get this straight. The aliens paralyzed the colonists, carried them over there, cocooned them to be hosts for more of those...

Yes.  That follows.

That is the question of the hour.  We could assume a parallel to certain insect forms who have hivelike organization. An ant of termite colony, for example, is ruled by a single female, a queen, which is the source of new eggs.

Well, the queen is always physically larger then the others.  A termite queen's abdomen is so bloated with eggs that it can't move at all.  It is fed and tended by drone workers, defended by the warriors.  She is the center of their lives, quite literally the  mother of their society.

Hard to say.  It may have been blind instinct...attraction to the heat of whatever...but she did choose to incubate her eggs in the one spot where we couldn't destroy her without destroying ourselves.  That's if she exists, of course.

How long until it blows?

I'm afraid so.  The crash did too much damage.  The overload is inevitable, at this point.

What?

All right.  Let's get on it.  What'll you need?

PLENTY!  TWENTY-SIX MINUTES!

She's alive.  They brought her here and you know it.

Well, I was going to wait until after the inquest...

Amanda Ripley-McClaren.  Married name, I guess.  Age:  sixty-six ...at time of death.  Two years ago.  I'm sorry.

Look, I believe you, but there are going to be some heavyweights in there.  You got Feds, you got interstellar commerce commission, you got colonial administration, insurance company guys...

Just tell them what happened.  The important thing is to stay cool and unemotional.

Hear me out...

Well, the corporation co-financed that colony with the Colonial Administration, against mineral rights.  We're getting into a lot of terraforming...'Building Better Worlds.'

Running loaders, forklifts, that sort of thing?

If you go.  It's a second chance, kiddo.  And it'll be the best thing in the world for you to face this fear and beat it.  You gotta get back on the horse...

No!  The answer is no.  Now please go.  I'm sorry.  Just go, would you.

Burke, just tell me one thing. That you're going out there to kill them.  Not study.  Not bring back.  Just burn them out...clean ...forever.

Well, it didn't occur to me.  It's been policy for years to have a synthetic on board.

I suggest you study the disks Ripley has been kind enough to prepare for you.

Yeah?  Maybe the organisms like the heat, that's why they built...

She's right.

Now hold on a second.  I'm not authorizing that action.

They can bill me.  I got a tab running.  What's second?

Bullshit!

Corporal Hicks!?

You just try getting a dangerous organism past ICC quarantine. Section 22350 of the Commerce Code.

You sent them to that ship.  I just checked the colony log... directive dates six-twelve-seventy-nine. Signed Burke, Carter J.

Look, maybe the thing didn't even exist, right?  And if I'd made it a major security situation, the Administration would've stepped in.  Then no exclusive rights, nothing.

You wouldn't be going in with the troops.  I can guarantee your safety.

We're trained to deal with these kinds of situations.

Dead on all channels.

It's insured.

PDT'S.  Personal-Data Transmitters. Every adult colonist had one surgically implanted.

Shit.  Apone, collect magazines from everybody.  We can't have any firing in there.

Thirty-eight...simulated.

The structure seems intact.  They have power.

Apone...where are your people? Anybody in D-Block?

Gorman!  Give it a rest would you.

I don't know.

So...then the fusion containment shuts down.

Shut up.  Just shut up!

All right, I guess.  One hell of a hangover.  Look, Ripley... I...

Sir?

Hudson, Sir.  He's Hicks.

...We're coming in.

Okay, stand by in operations.  Let's go.

Alive?

You tell me.  I only work here.

Sure, Hicks.

Not that tunnel, the other one!

Are you finished?  You okay?

Aye-firmative.

I want you two walking the perimeter. I know we're all in strung out shape but stay frosty and alert. We've got to stop any entries before they get out of hand.

Do it!

Six meters.  Five.  What the fu --

Fuckin' A!

Poor bastard.

About seventeen days.

We gotta figure on them getting into the complex.

On my way.

Can't tell.  Lots.  D gun's down to twenty.  Ten.  It's out.

But they don't know that.  They're probably looking for other ways to get in.  That'll take them awhile.

If it comes to that, I'll do us both.  Let's see that it doesn't Here, I'd like to introduce you to a close personal friend of mine.

Well, that's the grenade launcher ...you probably don't want to mess with that.

The only way it would work is if he sabotaged certain freezers on the trip back.  Then he could jettison the bodies and make up any story he liked.

Let's waste him.  No offense.

Get back here, both of you.  Fall back to Operations.

We didn't miss anything.

All right!  She's alive.  I believe it.  But we gotta get moving!  Now!

We ain't going anywhere.

Don't be long, Ellen.

Fuck you.

Hudson, give us a break.

The embryo, the second form, hosts in the victim's body for several hours.  Gestating.  Then it...  ...then it...emerges.  Moults. Grows rapidly --

Hey...hey!  Look, Crowe and Dietrich aren't dead, man.

Oh, God.  Jesus.  This ain't happening.

She survived longer than that with no weapons and no training.

Uh, what's next?

Oh, right!  Right!  With those things running around.  No way.

What do you mean, they cut the power?  How could they cut the power, man?  They're animals.

Just get back here!

Seal the door.

I don't know, an acid hole in a duct.  Something under the floors, not on the plans. I don't know!

They're right on us.  Vasquez, how you doing?

Can't be.  That's inside the room!

Yeah.  What?

Christ.  Some honch in a cushy office on Earth says go look at a grid reference in the middle of nowhere, we look.  They don't say why, and I don't ask.  I don't ask because it takes two weeks to get an answer out here and the answer's always 'don't ask.'

Tell him, as far as I'm concerned, he finds something it's his.

Terrible.

No.. I've slept enough.

What about me?

Why not?

You promise?

And hope to die?

The 'maze'?  You mean the air ducts?

You're really something, ace.

Oh.  Sorry, Newt.

Why do they tell little kids that?

Did one of those things grow inside her?

Did you ever have a baby?

Where is she?

I'll be right in the other room, Newt.  And look...I can see you on that camera right up there.

Wah...?  Where are...?

I know, honey.  Me too.

Look!

DO you know how to get to the landing field from here?

Newt, wait!

Newt, I want you to hang on, now.  Hang on tight.

That's right.

Yes, honey.  I think we both can.

It did not, however, contain any entries concerning the hostile life form you allegedly picked up.

Thank you, Officer Ripley.  That will be...

Sixty, maybe seventy families.

Then that would be eating and drinking I'd live like a Prince without thinking. The wisdom of old would be mine - A woman's much better than wine! Then that would be eating and drinking! The wisdom of old would be mine - A woman's much better than wine. She's much better than wine! She's much better than wine!

I need to net one birdie only And I will stop feeling so lonely. But if she won't fly to my aid, Then into a ghost I must fade. I need to net one birdie only But if she won't fly to my aid, Then into a ghost I must fade.  To a ghost I must fade! To a ghost I must fade!

At present the girls only peck me. Their cruelty surely will wreck me. But one little beak in my own, And I'll up to heaven be flown! At present the girls only peck me. But one little beak in my own, And I'll up to heaven be flown. Up to heaven be flown! Up to heaven be flown!

Certainly!

Indeed.

His Grace is very angry with you.

Oh? News travels fast in Vienna.

Yes.

No.

In a harem.

A brothel.

Perhaps.

You might be disappointed.

Looks and talent don't always go together, Katherina.

What?

Well, what does it matter to you?

You were sublime.

Extremely clever.

Don't bother!

I'm so relieved.

What??

Excuse us, Fraulein. Good night, Signore.

But he needs to be here in Salzburg, Your Grace. He needs me and he needs you. Your protection, your understanding.

Oh sir, yes! He's about to make the worst mistake of his life. Some little Viennese slut is trying to trick him into marriage. I know my son. He is too simple to see the trap - and there is no one there who really cares for him.

Yes, sir, that's the truth. But don't blame him. The fault is mine. I was too indulgent with him. But not again. Never again, I promise! I implore you - let me bring him back here. I'll make him give his word to serve you faithfully.

Oh, sir, he's never disobeyed me in anything. Please, Your Grace, give him one more chance.

Why do I have to be humiliated in front of my guests by one of my own servants?

I wish you to return immediately to Salzburg. Your father is waiting for you there patiently. I will speak to you further when I come.

Then try harder, Mozart. I have no intention of dismissing you. You will remain in my service and learn your place. Go now.

Dinner? How dare you? I am a nobleman. I only dine with people of my own height.

Oh shut up. I'm sick to death of that tune.

I want to go!

I want to go back to Vienna.

Yes!

I feel wrong. I feel wrong being here.

I am! I am! I'm stopping it - slowly. You see! Look, I've stopped. Now we are going back.

Yes! Back! Back! Listen - don't you know where you are?

We are in the Residence of the Fartsbishop of Salzburg.

Because here everything goes backwards. People walk backwards, dance backwards, sing backwards, and talk backwards.

Why? People fart backwards.

Yes, I think it's brilliant. You've been doing it for years.

Em iram! Em iram!

No, this is serious. Say it backwards.

Just say it - you'll see. It's very serious. Em iram!  Em iram!

What?

Eat

Eat my - ah!

Of course.

Oh, leave me alone.

Oh yes? You always know everything.

Well, don't do that again!

Don't be stupid.

Shut up! Just shut up! I don't need them.

Tell them to go away. I don't want to see anybody.

Tell them to go!

No!

Stop it, Wolfi. I look dreadful. Welcome to our house, Herr Mozart.

Tea? Who wants tea? Let's go out! This calls for a feast. You don't want tea, Papa. Let's go dancing. Papa loves parties, don't you?

What? How can you be so boring? Tea!

What does she want?

Well, ask her!

Oh, damn!

Stanzi!

Wolfi.

These gentlemen are from Salzburg.

Your father is dead.

I'm talking about now. How much will you give him now? Down payment?

Why not? Half the house!

Oh, Stanzi.

Well, you liked it, didn't you? Monkey-flunki-punki.

I'm not telling you.

You'd think I was mad.

Why?

Oh yes, sir. He's all right. And he's working on it very hard.

I can't write it!

It's killing me.

Madame. How can I help you?

He's terribly busy, sir.

Would it be too much trouble, sir, to ask you to look at them now? While I wait.

I - I really cannot do that, Your Excellency. You see, he doesn't know I'm here.

My husband is a proud man, sir. He would be furious if he knew I'd come.

Sir, we really need this job. We're desperate. My husband spends far more than he can ever earn. I don't mean he's lazy - he's not at all - he works all day long. It's just! he's not practical. Money simply slips through his fingers, it's really ridiculous, Your Excellency. I know you help musicians. You're famous for it. Give him just this one post. We'd be forever indebted!

Don't keep calling me that. It puts me at such a distance. I was not born a Court Composer, you know. I'm from a small town, just like your husband.

Yes.

Yes, sir. He doesn't make copies.

Oh, thank you, sir!

Tonight?

What for?

What do you mean?

But! I'm a married woman!

What?

Your husband is ill, ma'am. He took sick. I brought him home.

I was at hand.

He needs me, ma'am.

No. I was assisting him. He asked me.

Madame, I will respect his. He asked me to stay here.

Ah. Well. Ah,  I see you've got your manager with you. Well, Madame, how about half the receipts?

Not at all.

He's not in. But he's working on it. He said to tell you.

Leave him alone!

He's doing his best.

Money! Money!

Oh yes, and who are you? He's worked for Kings. For the Emperor.  Who are you?

Oh, yes.

In three months! Papa.

Adorable!

Behold!

Behold!

I am sorry, Madame. It is not permitted.

I am sorry, Madame, but I have my orders.

Young man, I am no stranger to theatres. I'm no stranger to insolence!

Gertrude!

Gertrude!

People who know say the girl's got talent. You must judge for yourself. If you think she stinks, say so.

Michael!

Yes. He is a little strange.

Ah, now! Here she comes.

Who was your teacher?

Thank you, Madame.  Come on now - courage. Play me something you know.

You are cattivo, Court Composer.  I want to meet this young man. Chamberlain, arrange a pleasant welcome for him.

It's just a trifle, of course.

You do me too much honour, Sire.

Finally! Such an immense joy. Diletto straordinario!

Your Highness.

I'm thinking about Herr Mozart. What is your view?

Yes?

And the result satisfies.

Ah-ha. Favouritism. But I so want Mozart.

You please me, Court Composer. A very clever idea.

Well. There it is.

Majesty, I did. Believe me, it was a most agonizing. decision. But finally, I simply could not recommend Herr Mozart.

Well, Sire, I made some inquiries in a routine way. I was curious to know why he had so few pupils. It is rather alarming.

Of course not.

Yes?

It is not a question of liking, Your Majesty. Your own law decrees it, I'm afraid.

No, no, please! It is not a holy relic.  You know we have met already? In this very room. Perhaps you won't remember it, you were only six years old.  He was giving the most brilliant little concert here. As he got off the stool, he slipped and fell. My sister Antoinette helped him up herself, and do you know what he did? Jumped straight into her arms and said, Will you marry me, yes or no?

The Director of our Opera. Count Orsini-Rosenberg.

Really? Oh, grazie, Signore! Sono commosso! E un onore per mo eccezionale. Compositore brilliante e famossissimo!

Did we vote in the end for German or Italian?

Because I've already found the most wonderful libretto!

In a Pasha's Harem, Majesty. A Seraglio.

What? On one hearing only?

Yes, indeed.

Oh, yes. Absolutely. German. Unquestionably!

Of course I do. It's very good. Of course now and then - just now and then - it gets a touch elaborate.

Well, I mean occasionally it seems to have, how shall one say?  How shall one say, Director?

My dear fellow, there are in fact only so many notes the ear can hear in the course of an evening. I think I'm right in saying that, aren't I, Court Composer?

Twenty-six.

Thank you, Sire!

Ah! By all means.

Yes, Sire.

Who told you this, Majesty?

Well, yes, I admit it is.

Well, Majesty, it is only a comedy.

Sire, I swear to Your Majesty, there's nothing like that in the story. I have taken out everything that could give offense. I hate politics.

Ah, love again.

I have no idea.

You are passionate, Mozart! But you do not persuade.

I agree, Majesty, but I'm afraid it's not possible. The young man is still in the pay of the Archbishop.

In my opinion, it is time we had a piece in our own language, sir. Plain German. For plain people.

Well. There it is.

Your Majesty, Herr Mozart -

Am I not welcome?

Oh, yes. Oh, I mean no - not exactly like this. I mean today - just today, Stanzi - I remember now. She had to go - yes! She had to help her mother. Yes, she's like that. Her mother's a very sweet woman, you'll see.

Don't you have a maid?

How is your financial situation?

That's not what I hear.

How many pupils do you have?

How many?

Oh, let's not talk about it.

It's a secret.

It's too dangerous, Papa. But they're going to love it. Ah, there she is!

Why not? Oh, come, Papa! What better way could I spend it than on you? My kissable, missable, suddenly visible Papa!

This is just a game, Papa.

But my penalty. I've got to have a penalty.

Mine?

I never saw this girl in my life.  Is this a kind of joke?

Papa!

Hush! I'm talking to His Majesty. Your Majesty, I wish to express only one thing - that you who are the Father of us all, could teach our children the gratitude they owe to fathers. It is not for nothing that the Fifth Commandment tells us: 'Honour your Father and Mother, that your days may be long upon the earth.'

I will, sir.

Yes, thank you, sir.

Bene.

Do any pupils come to the house?

Then how does he pay for all this? Does he work at all?

Really? What is it he's writing?

Yes what?

In there, sir.

I'm leaving. I'm not working there anymore. I'm scared!

You don't know what it's like. Herr Mozart frightens me. He drinks all day, then takes all that medicine and it makes him worse.

I don't know. He has pains.

Here, in his stomach. They bend him right over.

Please don't ask me to go back again. I'm frightened! I'm very, very frightened.

My name is Lorl, sir. I'm a maidservant. I was asked to come here and offer my services to you.

They'll be paid for by a great admirer or yours who wishes to remain anon - anonymous.

Yes. I can live in or out just as you wish.

Stanzi-Manzi-Banzi-Wanzi!

Papa, the rule is you can only give penalties that can be performed in the room.

Yes, well, it's all good fun.

I'd like to try them someday. I'm not sure I'd be much good at it.

Animals?

German!

No, no, I love that. I'd want it to be in German. I haven't done anything in German since Seraglio.

Wolfi!

What is this?

Oh! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! What have you got for me? Is it finished?

What? The vaudeville, what'd you think?

Can I see it?

Why not?

Well, we can.

Madame.

Well, yes! on the whole. I suppose.  How long have you been playing, Fraulein?

Well, I'm a good teacher. The next time you wish me to instruct another of your dogs, please let me know. Goodbye, Fraulein, goodbye, Madame! goodbye, Sir!

Is my pupil still anxious to learn the art of music?

Really? Perhaps your dear wife might care to profit from my instruction?

Well. Since it appears nobody is eager to hire my services, could you favour me with a little money instead?

If a man cannot earn, he must borrow.

Really?

Ah!

Ah, love! Well of course in Italy we know nothing about that.

But this is absurd!

It really is the best music one can hear in Vienna today. Don't you agree?

So you see, this post is very important to me right now.

Why? Here is the music. It's here. I am submitting it humbly. Isn't that what you wanted?

Filled? That's impossible! They haven't even seen my work. I need this post. Please, can't you help me? Please!

Whom did they choose?

Sommer? Herr Sommer? But the man's a fool! He's a total mediocrity.

But I can't lose this post, I simply can't! Excellency, please. Let's go to the palace, and you can explain to the Emperor that Herr Sommer is an awful choice. He could actually do musical harm to the Princess!

It has been said, my friend, that you are inclined to live somewhat above your means.

How is that possible? You give concerts, don't you? I hear they are quite successful.

Of course not.

I'm afraid not.

Ah, how exciting! Tell me more.

Cream cheese mixed with granulated sugar and suffused with rum. Crema al Mascarpone.

Forgive me. We all have patriotic feelings of some kind.

What exactly are you working on?

I don't think you should become known in Vienna as a debtor, Mozart. However, I know a very distinguished gentleman I could recommend to you. And he has a daughter. Will that do?

I don't know. They say I've got to re-write the opera, but it's perfect as it is. I can't rewrite what's perfect. Can't you talk to him?

Oh, I could kill him! I mean really kill him. I actually threw the entire opera on the fire, he made me so angry!

It's not fair that a man like that has power over our work.

I know; it's outrageous. Still, if the public doesn't like one's work one has to accept the fact gracefully.

Well, I can speak for the Emperor. You made too many demands on the royal ear. The poor man can't concentrate for more than an hour and you gave him four.

I think it's marvelous. Truly.

I wouldn't presume. All the same, if it wouldn't be imposing, I would like you to see my new piece. It would be a tremendous honour for me.

Grazie, mio caro, Wolfgang!

How could I not?

How could it not, Excellency?

I never knew that music like that was possible.

Oh no! One hears such sounds and what can one say, but - Salieri!

What work?

What dead? Who is dead?

Work fast. And be sure to tell no one what you do. You will see me again soon.

Are you neglecting my request?

Not here! She's not well, either. She went to the Spa.

I mean to come to my opera. You are the only colleague who did.

This is only a vaudeville.

I have bad fancies. I don't sleep well anymore. Then I drink too much, and think stupid things.

I'm too young to be so sick.

No! No, it's him!

The man. He's here.

Finish what?

Yes. Can I - could I help you, in any way?

My dear friend, it would be my greatest pleasure.

Of course.

Then, let us try together. I'd regard it as such an honour. Tell me, what is this work?

The end of the Recordare - Statuens in parte dextra.

Consigned to flames of woe.

What?

Oh, yes.

Come. Let's begin.

So now - A minor. Suddenly.

Yes.

I think so.

Yes.

First bassoon and tenor trombone - what?

Also identical?

Oh no. Now for the Fire.  Strings in unison - ostinato on all - like this.

Yes, yes - go on. The Voca Me. Suddenly sotto voce. Write that down: sotto voce, pianissimo. Voca me cum benedictis. Call me among the blessed.

Sopranos up to F on the second 'Voca'?

You go fast!

Yes.

Oh no. I'm not tired at all.

I can keep going, I assure you. Shall we try?

What for?

Exactly.

Well not especially. It can be in Turkish, if you really want. I don't care.

But, Your Majesty -

Just let me tell you how it begins.

Certainly, Herr Director.

Yes, but this is not a ballet. This is a dance at Figaro's wedding.

But surely the Emperor didn't mean to prohibit dancing when it's part of the story.

Oh yes, certainly. Certainly, Herr Director!

Mozart, you are not the only composer in Vienna.

A little modesty would suit you better.

Kapellmeister Bonno, Count Orsini- Rosenberg and Court Composer Salieri.

Mozart -

Look, young man, the issue is simple. If you want this post, you must submit your stuff in the same way as all your colleagues.

May I just do that, Majesty? Show you how it begins? Just that?

Oh, German! German! Please let it be German.

Why not? It's charming. I mean, I don't actually show concubines exposing their! their! It's not indecent!  It's highly moral, Majesty. It's full of proper German virtues. I swear it. Absolutely!

Baron!

Sire, only opera can do this. In a play, if more than one person speaks at the same time, it's just noise. No one can understand a word. But with music, with music you can have twenty individuals all talking at once, and it's not noise - it's a perfect harmony. Isn't that marvelous?

Elevated? What does that mean? Elevated! The only thing a man should elevate is - oh, excuse me. I'm sorry. I'm stupid. But I am fed up to the teeth with elevated things! Old dead legends! How can we go on forever writing about gods and legends?

I am Father Vogler. I am a Chaplain here. I thought you might like to talk to someone.

In the sight of God that is a sin.

I cannot leave alone a soul in pain.

Offer me your confession. I can offer you God's forgiveness.

My son, there is something dreadful on your soul. Unburden it to me. I'm here only for you. Please talk to me.

I'm surprised you don't know. It was a very popular tune in its day. I wrote it. How about this?

I regret it is not too familiar.

And do they believe it?

Do you believe it?

God's ways are not yours. And you are not here to question Him. Offer him the salt of penitence. He will give you back the bread of eternal life. He is all merciful. That is all you need to know.

I do not claim to unravel the mysteries. I treasure them. As you should.

His funeral - imagine it! The Cathedral, all Vienna sitting there. His coffin, Mozart's little coffin in the middle. And suddenly in that silence, music. A divine music bursts out over them all, a great Mass of Death: Requiem Mass for Wolfgang Mozart, composed by his devoted friend Antonio Salieri. What sublimity! What depth! What passion in the music! Salieri has been touched by God at last. And God, forced to listen. Powerless - powerless to stop it. I at the end, for once, laughing at Him. Do you understand? Do you?

The only thing that worried me was the actual killing. How does one do that? How does one kill a man? It's one thing to dream about it. It's very different when you have to do it, with your own hands.

I did.

I poisoned his life.

No, Father. From now on no one will be able to speak of Mozart without thinking of me. Whenever they say Mozart with love, they'll have to say Salieri with loathing. And that's my immortality - at last! Our names will  be tied together for eternity - his in fame and mine in infamy. At least it's better than the total oblivion he'd planned for me, your merciful God!

Don't pity me. Pity yourself. You serve a wicked God. He killed Mozart, not I. Took him, snatched him away, without pity. He destroyed His beloved rather than let a mediocrity like me get the smallest share in his glory. He doesn't care. Understand that. God cares nothing for the man He denies and nothing either for the man He uses. He broke Mozart in half when He'd finished with him, and threw him away. Like an old, worn out flute.

Yes?

Italian?

Yes.

I've seen the manuscript.

Incredible.

About the ballet.

Well done, Sire!

Did we?

For the same reason, Herr Chamberlain, that it was banned in France.

Well, the play makes a hero out of a valet. He outwits his noble master and exposes him as a lecher. Do you see the implications? This would be, in a grander situation, as if a Chamberlain were to expose an Emperor.

What? Who the devil are you?

I can't wait.

What do you mean - now?

Oh, I'm tender enough for you, my boy. I'm tender enough for you.

I agree, Baron.

No, Baron, no. I'm afraid Mozart is a lost cause. He has managed to alienate practically the whole of Vienna. He is constantly drunk. He never pays his debts. I can't think of one person to whom I dare recommend him.

Indeed. Just a moment - as a matter of fact I think I do know someone who could commission a work from him. A very appropriate person to do so. Yes.

Excuse me, my dear.

Show her in. Then go to bed.

He didn't say, sir. I told him I didn't know when you would be back, but he insisted on waiting.

Yes, I am looking after him.

Well, he's sleeping now. Better not.

Oh, yes. He's just exhausted. He became dizzy, that's all. We should let him rest.

Bene.

Yes.  And congratulations to all of you. It was superb.

Yes, indeed. Goodnight to you all now. It was perfection - truly!

The American? Yes, duck.

I'm an orderly, not a bleeding psychiatrist! I push things about, but I've little say what happens to them.

Yes, Doctor.

He said 'Jack'.

What happened to them?

No, sir. Of course, sir. Good day, Doctor.

Come to my office, Miss Price.

Yes, sir.

At my flat. I'm off at midnight and...

Has his friend appeared to him again?

What did he say?

Warn him?

I tried to investigate the attack. There are no records. The case was closed and now they've 'misplaced' the file. David's lacerations were cleaned and dressed when he arrived here and yet supposedly no doctor examined him before I did. The Goodman boy is already in the ground so he's no good to us. So I went to the pub in East Proctor where I was convinced of two things.

I think the village of East Proctor is hiding some dark and terrible secret. I'm convinced that, like David, they believe in this werewolf.

No. He knows no one in London, besides me. I shouldn't have left him alone.

Oh, I don't mean running about on all fours and howling at the moon. But in such a deranged state he could harm himself, or perhaps others.

Let's call the police and see if they can help us find our wandering boy.

Is he all right? Why didn't you call me? Where was he?

The zoo? Is he rational?

Yes, I should think so.

Yes, Doctor.

He's fine. We'll come right over.

No, a cab will be faster.

Tea would be nice.

David?

I beg your pardon?

What?

Yes?

I'm not very hungry, thank you.

Please, really. I'm not hungry.

Leave the pills. I'll take them later.

Shall I be forced to feed you, Mr. Kessler?

Shall I be forced to feed you, David?

Right.

I thought you were asleep.

'A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court' by Mark Twain.

I've just started it. My friend gave it to me.

I dream of death mostly.

That's not really a very proper question.

Twenty-eight.

I know.

Was Jack Goodman your good friend?

Shall I read to you?

A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court by Samuel L. Clemens. This is after the preface but before chapter one: A Word of Explanation. You all right?

Ahem, A Word of Explanation. It was in Warwick Castle that I came across the curious stranger whom I am going to talk about. He attracted me by three things: his candid simplicity, his marvelous familiarity with ancient armor, and the restfulness of his company - for he did all the talking. We fell together as modest people will in the tail of the herd...

I'm sorry I woke you up.

No, thank you. Just keep me company for a while.

I keep having these really terrible dreams. They are getting worse and I can't seem to stop them.

Will you think about it?

Not just a patient -- me.

Forgive me, I'm trying to cheer myself up and an affair with a beautiful nurse seemed like just the thing to do it.

A werewolf?

I'll let you know the next full moon.

Your dead friend Jack?

What do I think? You mean about the possibility of your becoming a monster in two days or about visits from dead friends?

I would think so.

Very nice.

Lovely.

There is only one bed.

It's nice to see you.

Yes?

I was awake and he was in my room.

That's good, Alex.  Reassure me.

Tell me that it's silly of me to be apprehensive.

Werewolves simply do not exist.

Yeah, I do, but go to work.

A doper werewolf.

See you later.

The zoo?

Don't you remember?

I should be committed.

I don't know why I feel so good. I haven't felt this good in a long time.

Pull over.

Six people mutilated? It had to be me, Alex.

Jack is dead!

Rational!?! I'm a fucking werewolf, for Christ's sake!

I swear, I don't know this girl.

Will you shut up!?!!

David, let's go now.

No.

No.

No.

No.

No!

No.

Yes, I should think. He called out just now.

Chart says he's from New York.

Why on earth do you say that?

Really, Susan, I don't think that was very proper, and besides, it's common practice now.

Has he been refusing food?

Yes, Mrs. Hobbs.

You did, did you?

Hey, you asshole! I want you to arrest me!

Queen Elizabeth is a man! Prince Charles is a faggot! Winston Churchill was full of shit!

Shakespeare was French! The Queen Mother sucks cocks in hell! Shit! Fuck! Piss!

You've left my wife a widow and my children fatherless. And I understand that I am to walk the earth one of the living dead until the wolf's bloodline is severed and the curse lifted.

No, but we're about to.

Quiet, everyone! Hush! Shhh!

Oh, come on, tell us.

You could have told them!

I was having a nightmare.

What time is it?

Alex?

What are you going to see?

Do you have bad dreams, too?

Yes, but does everyone kill Bambi?

Where am I?

London? Where's Jack? I had a strange dream.

The guy I was with. Is he all right? How did I get to London?

Get your fucking hands off me! What the hell is going on here?

You've suffered some rather severe cuts and bruises, lost a bit of blood, but nothing too serious; black and blue for a while. You'll have some dueling scars to boast of. That lunatic must have been a very fierce fellow. They say a mad man has the strength of ten.

So they said.

Sure, as a kid. But never so real. Never so bizarre.

I've told you, it wasn't a man. It was an animal. A big wolf or something. A rabid dog.

Look, Dr. Hirsch, I know I've been traumatized, but Jack was torn apart. I saw him. A man can't do that to someone with his bare hands.

Then why the hell are you so quick to disbelieve me? You yourself said it must have taken incredible strength to tear apart a person like that.

You really think I'm crazy, don't you?

Yes.

David.

Oh, I don't know. I mean look around. Isn't this a fun place?

I'm sorry. Northern England first, Italy later.

I think Debbie Klein is a mediocre person with a good body.

She's a jerk.

I'm talking about a girl you want to fuck, so give me a break.

I don't know.

If you don't stop, I'm going to kill you.

It just fascinates me that you can spend so much energy on someone so dull.

We've known Debbie what, since the eighth grade? How many years of foreplay is that?

Of course, The Slaughtered Lamb. Why else would they have a severed fox head on a spear as their symbol?

Of course, The Slaughtered Lamb. Why else would they have a severed wolf's head on a spear as their symbol?

A severed wolf's head on a pike as their symbol.

Shall we?

Nice to see you.

Listen, at least it's warm in here.

You ask them.

Wrong.

You ask them.

What do you mean? I'm starving.

Apparently so.

I don't know. Let's see if there's an inn or something up the road.

I don't know. Now that we're out here and it's three degrees, I'm not so sure I wouldn't rather face a blood-thirsty mob.

I have no idea.

I see and they were too embarrassed to talk about it, because they felt so silly.

I'm well aware of how pleasant the weather is in Rome at the present time thank you.

I heard that.

There aren't any coyotes in England.

Pecos Bill.

Heathcliffe didn't howl.

It's a full moon, 'beware the moon'.

Yeah.

Anywhere! I think we should just keep moving.

It's circling us.

Plan?

Do you think it's a dog?

A sheep dog or something. Turn slowly and let's walk away.

Walk away, Jack.

No.

Yeah.

I'll tell you when we get there.

Are you going to help me up?

Get the fuck out of here, Jack.

This is too much. I can't handle this.

Hurting your feelings? Has it occurred to you that it may be unsettling to have you rise from your grave to visit me? Listen to me, I'm talking to a hamburger!

Aren't you supposed to be buried in New York someplace?

Why should you be surprised? You were a very well-liked person.

I can't stand it.

David!

David, now I know this may be hard for you, but I have to warn you.

I'm a grisly sight, it's true; but I love you and that's why I'm here. You've got to know.

We were attacked by a werewolf.

On the moors, we were attacked by a lycanthrope, a werewolf.

I was murdered, an unnatural death, and now I walk the earth in limbo until the werewolf's curse is lifted.

What?!

What are you talking about? I won't accept this! Get out! God damit!

Stop it, Jack.

You're talking like Boris Karloff! It's movie dialogue!

Nurse!

Nurse! Oh God! Alex!

Don't be an asshole, David. Come here.

I wanted to see you.

Yes.

David, tomorrow night is the full moon. You'll change, you'll become...

What do you think?

The canines will be real. You'll taste real blood! God damit, David, please believe me! You'll kill and make others like me! I'm not having a nice time, David! Don't allow this to happen again! You must take your own life!

Hi, David.

If I was still alive, I probably would.

Thank you.

Hello.

How shall I do it?

If you did it wrong, it would be painful. You'd choke to death.

Well, then, what can I do for Scotland Yard?

Has David Kessler anything to say concerning the attack on the moors?

Regardless of what you think, Lieutenant, the fact remains that David is missing and that we must find him.

Stay here. If we need you, we'll know where to reach you.

Roger Mathison, Doctor.

He's on the telephone.

Campari and soda would do nicely.

Oh, that's been there for two hundred years. We were going to paint it out, but it's traditional, so we left it.

No.

We've got spirits and beer. If it's something hot you want, you can have tea.

No.

But I can heat some up for you if you'd like.

I beg your pardon?

Has Mr. Kessler said anything regarding the attack on the moors?

And what, Sergeant?

That is precisely my point. David, as far as we are concerned, the matter is closed. We won't trouble you any further. Good day.

We'll find him, not to worry.

You here again? What do you want?

I'll tell you why. I don't like the crowd you're mixed up with.  Personally, you can have all the credit you want. But for that deal - not a cent.

She's a widow. I don't like taking mortgages from widows.

Yes - sure

I was the first one to see it. I was coming down the stairs, and there was the watchman lying dead at my feet.

No kidding. When I saw it, you could'a knocked me over with a pin.

Yeah.

How much?

It was more than that last week.

Here's twenty-five thousand.

Yeah.

Ten bucks? Say, if I had ten bucks, I'd quit.

Yeah?

Baby, I can't give you anything but love...

It'll be yours if you don't kick in with that ten bucks.

Aw, nerts!

I'm fourteen cents out, and it took me half an hour to find the mistake. And me with a date, too.

Yeah.

Say, don't annoy me. I got troubles of my own.

Not yet, Mr. Clark.

Yes, sir.

Yes, sir.

Dickson doesn't have to go. But he must agree to this merger with New York Trust

What good will that do?  Why, it will take control away from him. We'll put somebody else in charge, call in all doubtful loans, and be on safe ground again. That's what good it will do!

Take it easy, Clark.

All right, let him! I'm sick and tired of hearing about him. If he wants to run the bank, let him do it. I don't want any part of it.

Not at all. That's Alexander Hamilton's idea[5] - the finest banking mind this country has ever known. Those are his exact words, gentlemen. Character!  It's the only thing you can bank on, and it's the only thing that will pull this country out of the doldrums.

I know, Dickson. That's all very well. But you're taking too many chances. In these times a bank should keep liquid in case of trouble. In case of emergency!

Gentlemen, you notice Mr. Dickson refuses to consider our wishes. He refuses an offer to merge with the New York Trust - the only thing that will put this bank on safe ground. He insists upon running a bank on so flimsy a thing as . . . as faith!

What about?

That sounds very simple, Dickson, but why should we jeopardize our personal fortunes?

Aw, they've gone crazy. You can't reason with a mob.

I can't? You just wait and see. If that run doesn't stop within the next hour, I'll shut the doors. You know what that means? The bank examiner will step in tomorrow. You'll be forced to liquidate. I'll insist upon it. The depositors will be paid one hundred cents on the dollar. What's left you gentlemen can have. But I'll guarantee there won't be enough to pay your next month's garage bill.

The bank. All right. Do anything you want with it.

We've been waiting fifteen minutes

Of course, yes. Just what would you like to know, Inspector?

That's very simple. I was home.

Oh yes, of course. There was someone with me. A lady.

If you don't mind, Inspector, I'd rather not say - that is, unless it becomes absolutely essential. You see, she's married.

You understand?

Somebody must be in good humor. He was humming "Mother Machree."

All right, Jack, all right.

Stand back, Inspector. Let me out of here, or I'll shoot you!

They took my keys yesterday. I went there to get them back.

Claims he was there with a married woman. Doesn't want to mention her name.

I don't know. It's all been like a crazy nightmare, Mr. Dickson.

But I didn't kill that man last night. Honest I didn't, Mr. Dickson!

Nothing, nothing, Mr. Dickson. Don't pay any attention to me. I don't know what I'm saying.

She just came up for a drink. Just for a few minutes.

Get out, get out!

I haven't got it.

I'm sorry, Dude, butI

Why not?

You don't have to do nothing.

All you gotta do is fix a few things for us , and we'll do the rest, see?

You? No, you'll be all right, so long as you establish an alibi for tonight.

Be sure you're with somebody responsible in case any questions are asked. Understand?

Listen, buddy, you're getting by pretty easy. Quit squawking!

Why, I needed a

Being alone with you has always done this to me. You know that.

What is?

If I thought you were the slightest bit interested, I would.

But you see, it isn't blarney where you're concerned.

Yes, yes, it does. What are you doing tonight, Phyllis?

Please, please don't laugh at me, Phyllis. I must see you tonight!

Now Phyllis, if you don't invite me, I'm coming anyway.

No, they won't. Not when you are there. Oh, please, be a sport. Please ask me.

Don't you know?

I want to be near you!

Don't you know I've been crazy about you for years?

I've loved you ever since I can remember, long before you married Tom Dickson.

No. No, I'm not. I deliberately avoided you. I was afraid of making a fool of myself. But I won't stand it any longer

My apartment.

Come on up for just a few minutes. We'll have just one drink, then we'll go.

What's the matter? Afraid papa will spank?

Good for you. Come on.

I'm not afraid of you. You haven't got a moustache!

What are you doing here?

Yes, sir.

Now?

Oh, yeah?

Oh no, Mr. Cluett, if it's all the same to you, I'd rather not wait. It's about you and Mrs. Dickson.

You've no right to do this to her, Mr. Cluett. Why don't you think it over? It's only gonna get you into a lot of trouble.

I guess I have said enough  I'm just wasting my breath talking to you.

John, how's your wife this morning?

Got a handkerchief?

Wait a minute.  How do you feel this morning?

That makes it unanimous. I feel all right too.

Of course, let them in! You're late now.

Well, that's too bad. Mine's all right too.

Hello, darling.

It's amazing that your sweet, lovely, gorgeous wife can ever get to see you.

Nothing. Tom, I thought you were going out with me tonight.

Yes.

But I have to go, dear. It's a very important banker's meeting.

Listen, it isn't so terribly important. We can go to the theatre any time.

Ho, ho, ho, yourself! I wouldn't laugh if I were you. You may not suspect it, but I'm still attractive - to some.

Well . . .

Tomorrow night?

Last night? Er - why - uh, last night . . .

Guess we'll just have to sacrifice the bank. When are you and Matt going to get married?

Ummm. Stalling, eh?  Anything new?

Directors, eh? Long faces?

I haven't got any new stories for them this morning, either.

Yes, sir.

Where is he now?

Now don't you worry about it.

Yes, sir.

Numbers? No, never mind.

Good morning.

Oh, no! It's not for you. You're only going to get married. Mrs. Dickson and I are going to go on the honeymoon.

Helen, I'm going to Philadelphia, just as soon as the bank closes. Make all the arrangements, will you?

Mr. Sampson . . .

Yes?

Good morning, Mr. Dickson.

Yes, thank you.

Ah, Mrs. Pembroke. I spoke to Mr. Schaffer at the Guaranty. He's going to take care of that mortgage for you . . .

I haven't any.

No, sir.

Why, I don't know.

Yes, sir.

And what's more, keep up the good work and who knows - some day you'll be the fellow sitting behind that desk . . .  Not a bad thought, eh?

Sure, I think it's swell.

Aw, go on, forget it. You came through, didn't you? That's all I wanted. A lot of them didn't think you would. You don't know how much satisfaction it's been to me. It's been swell. Well, when are you and Helen going to get married?

I suppose you want me to fix that up for you too, eh?

There you are.

You're protecting somebody.

Yes, you are. You're protecting somebody. Now listen, it doesn't make any difference who it is. It can't be as important as this. Now come on, tell me. Where were you last night?  Come on, don't be a fool. Matt, you trust me, don't you?

Why wouldn't you tell me where you were last night?

Were you in Cluett's apartment?

She was, wasn't she? How long has this been going on? Do you know?

But I haven't . . .

I'm afraid I must, Mr. Dickson.

It's an inside job. That's a cinch. Whoever did it had a pretty good picture of the layout. Now Brown, here, is in charge of the vaults, isn't he?

The clock opposite the vault was stopped by a bullet at 12:09.

Good.  You've got nothing to worry about. Soon as the report comes in, you'll be released.  And listen, don't talk so loud. Take it easy. Coast a little.

So have you. So have I. So's everybody got a record. What difference does that make? You can't go around pinning crimes on people just because they

No wonder he didn't want to mention her name.

Don't worry, Mr. Dickson. We'll find out whether he's telling the truth. I'll have a man from headquarters check up on it right away.

Here's the data on the Clyde deal.

I'm afraid he's been stalling.

What are you talking about?

Yes, sir.

Did you get the case for the securities?

Don't you think I know it?

Get all the big bills in the place. Take them out and get them changed. Get nothing but ones and fives. Distribute them among the tellers. Tell them to take their time. Stall as much as possible. Count and recount the money.

I hate to do this, but I've got to have time to dig up some help. I think I know where I can get some real cash. Snap into it, Sampson. We will lick this thing yet.

But you said it would be safe! It's his life insurance money. Oh, please, I'll go to the Old Ladies' Home if you don't do something, please!

Is that busy husband of mine busy?

Board meeting. Oh, that means hours, I suppose.

Helen, did you ever try competing with a bank?

Well, take my word for it, and don't try it. It's useless!  If it were some other woman, I could handle her, but after all, you can't scratch a bank's eyes out now, can you?

All right.

Matt, come here!

Come here, honey!

Oh, is that so?

With what?

A friend of mine - yeah, really - his mother was terribly sick and she was dying, would you believe it?

All right, I'm lying. Don't forget you called me a liar.

Yeah, swell.

Yeah.

I tell you, I saw them!

Yes, right in his office, the rat. I'd like to take a crack at that guy.

Oh, Charlie again.

Who? Cluett? No, not yet. But I'd like to take a crack at that stiff- necked, horse dollar.[6]

Can you imagine that guy? He was kissing her.

Okay, honey - but just the same I'd like to take a crack at that

All right, dear.

Don't cry, honey. Everything's gonna be all right.

Something's happened. He isn't trying anymore.

Yes. He called some of the biggest people in town.

Yeah.  I got an idea. Come on, let's get to a telephone.

Mr. Williams . . .

Matt, look! There's Mr. Jones!

Yes, why?

I've been trailing the cashier like you told me. You're right about that guy, chief. There's something screwy somewhere.

He left here about an hour ago and went down to Dude Finlay's joint.

Yes, sir.

Sure I do. He has the best room in me house. The one with the fancy wallpaper.

What time was it, Mrs. Halligan?

Huh?

Now, let me see - a half hour after the Dooley sisters - and the Dooley sisters never get home until after

It couldn't have been earlier?

Yes, I know. Cause the Dooley sisters weren't in yet.

There you are!

That's all, Mrs. Halligan. Thanks.

wasn't anywhere near this place

I didn't do it! I haven't got a gun!

I don't know.

Yes.

Well, about - uh - eleven o'clock.

Yes.

Then where were you?

I'm okay, Matt.

Yeah, what did he do with his first one?

I guess so.

I said like a Comanche, not this Comanche.

Tom, I'm this close to coming with you...

Jim Younger, I told you--

Sometimes a wound will kill.

Dammit, this stopped being fun about two years ago!

Never a good thing.

Anywhere nobody's shooting at me is pretty.

That was two hours ago.

Zee, I'm pleased you came.

The sheriff says it was a gang of drunk Kansas boys.

Better pass them over here before something happens to 'em.

How?

Frankly, yes. I'm feeling a little left out.

What?

It's still taking too long. The people used to snap to.

Leave me alone, Bob.

What have you done?

WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!

Swear.

Swear on Jimmy's grave.

He's not bad at it.

Well, somebody better go tell THE DAMN YANKEES!

Stop by our spread after that, tell our Ma we're all right. We'll go to Doc Mimms.

Oh no...

Tomorrow.

Best damn plan I heard all war.

Two.

Not yet. But I'm hoping.

Well, no, Jesse, it was the bank's. That's why we had to go to all that trouble of stealing it.  You explain it to him.

Hey!

One false move and I'll blow your heads off!

You heard me, Jesse. You know how crazy I get!

Yes. I am obviously not standing out in people's minds at the robberies.

You are a fine figure of a man.

He's been full of vinegar lately.

What?

Tell me.

I think I recognize you.

I think I saw you leavin' by the front door just as I was coming in the back.

No, really. You're wife said she needed some help, seeing as you were so fat you couldn't find your --

What's going on?

I could use the walk.

Planting corn. Harvesting corn. Year after year.

You're not scared, are you?

What is wrong with you?

She got two of them.

She was European!

After all you did on our farm?  You miss it, don't you Jesse?

It was exciting.

So what do we do, General Lee?

Perfect, Cole.

I got three.

Just because he reads all those books and knows all those big words doesn't make him smart.

It's better. It's a construction depot. They'll have the strongbox and some ammo and explosives for us to take. That way we can take on a bigger job.

Twenty?!

Sure, cousin.

Yep.

Hold on, hold on, we all know Bob is an important part of the gang.

What will be?

If you'd read about it first, you'd have no problems.

I've robbed just as many banks as you have! I know this town, and I know this bank, and I say it's an easy job.

That's it.

And I'm the better outlaw.

You'll be smiling once you've got all that money to spend, cousin.  Cole Younger's going to make everybody rich!

A trap.

Clell, Tom, go get Doc Mimms in Liberty!

Pass me some whisky.

I'm out.

Who's next? You? Me? Bob?

Missed you too, cousin.

Pff. All we been through, the thought never crossed my mind.

We didn't. Zerelda did. Turns out your wife makes a hell of an outlaw.

You pay me to find you Bluecoats. There they are.

Hmm. Go back to the reservation and get drunk in a dirt shack, or work for you...

I'm thinking...

Both would be nice.

Must be a garrison in town. We're in occupied territory, boys.

Which one, right or left?

Sadie was not a man!

Shakespeare.  He's European.

Get buckets!

Strategically.

Oh, you're in charge? We ain't partners any more, Jesse? You tell Cole Younger where and when to ride?

They gonna rush us?

Of course!  Uh, sir?

Where is Jesse James?

The District Marshall

Ho-yah. Him say tell Big Lawman in Carville that badman Jesse James riding toward Rising Sun, above Great River, near Eagle Rock.

Ho-yah!

You're right, sir.

On account of we're robbing it.

It's a secret.

I'd appreciate that.

What is it?

So?

I had you covered.  From back there.

My little Web did that?

Go home, Doc.  They ain't gonna hang no more Liberty boys.

Go on. You're pretty much all healed up.

The bullet came out clean, but he lost a whole lot of blood. Praying wouldn't hurt.

I fooled them into thinking I was alone.

I'm upset too, Zee, but Jesse and Cole know what they're doing. I'm sure they won't press their luck.

So we got a plan?

Pff. They hardly even noticed you.

Mm-hmm.

You could have worn one of those big, floppy woman's Easter Sunday hats.

No, Jesse, your problem is you're always doing stuff before I'm finished figuring it out.

I reckoned.

We better go to Doc's, see what's going on here.

You're doing just fine.

Think about this. If we just come up with a story and stick to it, we should be all right.

You can shut up now.

What worries me is that Jesus is talking back.

Heard of him.

Damn. All that reading paid off.

What do you think?

Shut up.  Uh, Doc, I was wondering if, uh, this evening, I could come by?

Ma.

Don't care.

Make a thousand of 'em. Still won't be enough by the time I'm through.

Fine. How'd it go out here?

And that's why you both lead the gang. Two of you went into that bank together, right?

And I do so want to shoot some Pinkerton detectives.

It's the scientific method. It's all the rage.

Bob's upset.

Bob here'll kill a man for sneezing, and he's the best shot in the gang.

Jesse, we're outlaws.

I can't quit and leave you alone. I can't quit until you quit. Ma would've wanted it that way.

Maybe it started out that way. But now...

A better life than the one you could have had with Zee?

Oh yeah.

No, I --

Jim was old enough...

Yeah.

I'm sure it seemed like a good idea at the time.

See you soon. Oh, and I appreciate the distraction back there.

Yeah, Jimmy?

I know. But that's how it should have ended. Your Dad and Mom, riding off into a new life, growing old together, happy.

Sounds like he was a hell of a man.

They're making him a hero now.

So what was he?

Yeah Jimmy?

Everything but the boring parts.

A fair number, Ma.

Somebody's in a vengeful smiting mood today.

Boys?

We know, Ma. Now we got to get you to Doc Mimms.

Shush.

You were little Jesse James when you left.

If there's anything we can do for you, Dr. Mimms. We want to help.

Mmmm.

Nuh-huh ...

I've been on my back two weeks. I'm sick of it.

No! I mean, of course not. No.

I wasn't the only one risking my neck that day.

Unfair. You are completely unfair.

You didn't want to farm?

Thank God you grew out of that.  You did grow out of that, didn't you?

You planning on being a bachelor your whole life, Jesse James?

And what's this right girl like?

Where will you find such a girl?

Sparkling rocks?

Is this one of Frank's Shakespeare poems you're trying to quote?

Frank and me have to go away for a while.

Me neither.

Laws don't touch men like Thaddeus Rains. Only justice does.

When my name makes them cry in their sleep. When I've brought them to ashes.

Jesse. What are you thinking? There are bounty hunters and lawmen all over this county!

She's the most wonderful woman in the world. Can't get her out of my mind.

She's beautiful. Smart. And has the biggest... buck teeth in all of Missouri.

That's why I picked it. We can start a whole new life down here.

Oh, I'm not finished.  "When he sauntered into a saloon, his spurs jangling and his pockets full of gold, the ladies flocked around him like flies to a candied apple."  As I said. Hmm.

Jesse, have you ever noticed that when you're trying to charm your way out of trouble, your accent gets all farm boy?

Stop it. This is just sad.

What?

Yes ma'am.

You are a hell of a woman.

Yes ma'am.

But I like the presidential suite.

So I'll get a fair trial in front of a jury bought off by Thaddeus Rains?

Not that day. I am guilty of many things, but that was Mr. Thaddeus Rains and Parker, that day.

Pity.

Last February?

You had all those cattle there, so I'd think the extra men were in town from the cattle drive?

I went myself to oversee the operation. Didn't help much.

I'm not hanged yet.

Ahh, you'll miss me.

He's too important, James.  They'll set the army on you. You and your wife.

Thanks.

Fair enough.

I could have lied I suppose, but I want this marriage to be legal. I just want you to know, I'm trying to start a new life here. I'm depending on your...

Thank you.

Right here in church?

I'm the same age you were when you went off to war.

No.

You been with a girl ever?

I think so.

I swear.

It's his money.  He's putting up the payroll out of his own fortune. You do want to hurt Thaddeus Rains, don't you Jesse?

This time we'll make an exception.

You're gonna tell her when you're resting up in bed with her, Jimmy.

I hope you don't mind, Jesse James told me your name.

I hope I'm not being too forward.

I just though you were awful cute.

Lyla Devereux.

That is so gentlemanly of you.

Really?

I'm doing you folks a favor --

It's not my job to relax. I've put men facing out both ways down Main Street, so nobody can ride in shooting. I've got a sharpshooter up on the water tower just in case.

They had to be dealt with!

They donate money to farmers, to churches. Rumor has it they gave the sharecroppers of Maddox so much money they were able to build a school.

Move you fools!

And it is my pleasure to be here.

Two weeks ago, we managed to arrange to have the Army hang one of the local farmers.

Unfortunately not, sir. A gang of local thugs managed to rescue him from the gallows. Not only has this inspired resistance from the other farmers, the redoubtable Mr. Alan Pinkerton was seriously injured during the incident.

Yes sir.

A further impediment is that the Army garrison has been ordered to move on from Liberty. We will no longer have that particular stick with which to threaten the farmers.

I see. I'll get together four patrols of our detectives for action tonight.

How much did they get from the safe?

I'll kill them for blowing up my railway!

What is going on here, man?

We should go burn that school to the ground, sir!

Sir?

I remember you.

I'm afraid our adversaries don't agree.

It is a nice piece of writing.

Oh, that's the best part.

I'm losing millions of dollars and months of time while you play chess with these farmers!

So you can't tell me anything?

I can't believe this.

I demand action.

Can't you tell me anything?

No.

Can you put men at all four?

What is that?

Vengeance.

What? Oh, I'm...busy.

Stop it. I'm...

Pumpkin?

Pumpkin you're dating an asshole.

Pumpkin, you're dating a tumbling, tumbling dickweed.

Courtney? Dinner?

Nice?

The question is do you like it, Courtney? And will you blow off a fucking phone call from your sad excuse for a boyfriend to eat there tonight.

Eight?

Is that Donald Trump's car?

You know, Courtney, you should take some more lithium. Or have a Diet Coke. Some caffeine might get you out of this slump.

Champagne on the rocks. Oh-could I have that with a twist? She starts to sink back in her chair and Bateman leans over and pulls her back up.

Yes, dear.

Mmmm...thanks, Patrick.

Yes, Luis is a despicable twit. I hate him.

Turn the light on.

Take it off.

Because you have to leave half an inch at the tip   to catch the force of the ejaculate! BATEMAN I'm getting out of here. Where's your lithium?

Well, it's not a turn-on for me. I have a promotion coming to me. I don't want to get AIDS.

Maybe.

Dinner at the River Cafe. Au Bar afterwards, maybe.

You and...Luis?

You look marvelous. There's nothing to say. You're going to marry Luis. Next week, no Less.

Yes?

You just haven't been looking.

I'm not supposed to.  But I can make an exception.

Actually, that's none of your business, Christie, hut I can assure you it certainly wasn't cheap.

Oh this won't be anything like last time, I promise.

Alright.

Well, I actually might need a little surgery after last time.

My friend told me I should maybe even get a lawyer.

Do...what.

Evelyn?

Is your Evian spiked?

No-I can't take the time off work.

Because I...want...to...fit...in.

Hi. Pat Bateman.

Oh God, Patrick. Why Price? Price?

Everybody's rich.

Everybody has a great body now.

I think, Evelyn, that we've...lost touch.

My need to engage in homicidal behavior on a massive scale cannot be, um, corrected, but I have no other way to fulfill my needs.

Talk about what, Patrick? What is there to talk about?

Touchy, touchy. I'm sorry I brought the wedding up. Let's just avoid the issue, alright? Now, are we having coffee?

But your friends are my friends. My friends are your friends. I don't think it would work.  You have a little something on your upper lip.

Yes, I am.

We never really shared one.

I know my behavior is...erratic sometimes.

Oh God, I can't believe this.

I'm just leaving.

I have to return some videotapes.

What are the rules for a sweater vest?

Good coloring.

Nice.

I know her. I knew her.

How did you guess?

Thanks, guy, but...she's got a lousy personality.

Ed Gein? Maitre d' at Canal Bar?

Is that all you ever have to contribute, Van Patten? "What about fucking dinner?"

I'm looking for...Paul Owen's...place.

No, he doesn't.

There was no ad in the Times.

Face it-the Japanese will own most of this country by the end of the '90s.

But wait, Harold, what do you mean?

Oh Christ. He can barely pick up an escort girl, let alone...what was it you said he did to her?

No! Listen, don't you know who I am? I'm not Davis, I'm Patrick Bateman! I talk to you on the phone all the time! Don't you recognize me? You're my lawyer.

But that's simply not possible. And I don't find this funny anymore.

It's just not.

No, you...didn't?

Lucky, I guess.

Uh huh.

Your compliment was sufficient Luis.

No, Luis. It's not me. You're mistaken.

Commes des Garcon.

Jesus lives, Luis.

Where are you going?

Patrick?

It looks that way, doesn't it?

That's not Paul Owen. Paul Owen's on the other side of the room. Over there.

Maybe it's just the light.

What?

Like what?

New card. What do you think?

Listen to me, Patrick. I'm leaving.

I'm leaving! I...am...leaving!

No, you dumb son of a bitch. I'm serious. I'm disappearing.

I'm just a happy camper. Rockin' and a-rollin'. VAN PATTEN  Rehab's done wonders for you, pal. Working for UNICEF now?

Umm...yes...I know it's a little late but is it possible to reserve a table for two at eight or eight-thirty perhaps?

Your friend has already been seated. Follow me, Mr. Halberstam.

Two at nine? Perfect.

See you then.

Aerobics class. Sorry. Any messages?

I occasionally box with Ricky at the Harvard Club. Anyone else?

When?

Negative. Cancel it.

Just...say...no.

No, silly. Forget it. I'll make them. Thanks.

No. No. Be a doll and just get me a Perrier, okay?

I said "Do not wear that outfit again." Wear a dress. A skirt or something.

Come on, you're prettier than that.

Patrick, a Mr. Donald KIMBALL is here to see you.

Patrick, I think he knows you're here. It's only ten-thirty.

Can you bring Mr...

Yes, Patrick?

Oh no. I have no plans.

Let's not think about what I want. How about anywhere you want.

Come on. Where do you want to go? Anywhere you want. Just say it. I can get us in anywhere.

Oh, I don't know. No, we'll go anywhere you want.

You didn't give them a name.

Thanks, Patrick. I'd love some.

I'm on a diet. But thank you.

No. It's all right. I'm not very good at controlling it anyway.

Well, I'd like to travel. And maybe go back to school, but I really don't know...I'm at a point in my life where there seems lo be a lot of possibilities, but I'm so... I don't know...unsure.

No, not really.

Are you seeing anyone? I mean, seriously?

Jean, do you feel...fulfilled? I mean, in your life?

Growing. I'm glad you said that.

Who's Ted Bundy?

What's that?

Patrick, have you ever wanted to make someone happy?

Sorry. 

Make someone happy-have you ever wanted to?

Hmmmm.

I know I should go. I know I have a tendency to get involved with unavailable men, and...I mean, do you want me to go?

No. No, I guess not. I don't want to get bruised. You're right, I should go.

Thanks. It slipped my mind completely.

Jean? Hello? Jean?

Hello? Jean, I need help!

Jean-I'm not-

Oh God, what did you say, you dumb bitch?

I don't think I'm gonna make it, Jean.

Why?

What is it, Patrick? Are you alright?

What do you think I do?

No. Flattering, but no.

Well, most guys I know who work in mergers and acquisitions don't really like it.

That's...that's too bad.

No. I really don't.

Hello 

Isn't it ridiculous? Coming all the way up here, but you know. They really are the best.

Oh yeah. Oh I get it. Fun with chocolate.

Oh, I don't know, Victoria. I'm at work all the time.

Oh, can't, I'm afraid. Matinée of Les Miserables. Listen, I've really got to go. I'll-Oh...Christ...I'll call you.

If you had an American Express card she'd give you a blowjob.  Listen, this girl worked in a tanning salon, need I say more?...What do you do?

Uh huh?

You're at Paul Owen s.

Paul Owen.

No.

Patrick, you re a lunatic.

Let's not get lewd.  I'm in no mood to have a lewd conversation.

No! I'm not a lesbian. Why do you think I'd be into that?

You actually listen to Whitney Houston? You actually have a Whitney Houston CD? More than one?

No, I'm sorry. I should've made an appointment.  Was that anything important?

Hi. Pat Bateman. Nice to meet you.

I've been hired by Meredith Powell to investigate the disappearance of Paul Owen.

So it's nothing that official. I just have some basic questions. About Paul Owen. About yourself-

No, I'm okay.

Mr. Kimball a bottle of San Pelle-

It's no problem

I think his family wants this kept quiet.

No, really. I'm okay.

Shoot.

Twenty-six. I'll be twenty-seven in October.

Fifty-five West Eighty-First Street. The American Gardens Building.

Thanks.

Who do you ask?

I know. I'm sorry.

No, I guess it's okay.

I'm...at a loss. He was part of that whole...Yale thing, you know.

What do you mean...Yale thing?

Hang...out?

No, he just hung out there.

I just wanted to know if you know. BATEMAN Before Yale? If I remember correctly, Saint Paul's... Listen, I just...I just want to help.

Do you have any witnesses or fingerprints?

Well, maybe he did, huh?

But...has anyone seen him in London?

Oh.

Yikes! No. Paul wasn't into that. He followed a balanced diet and-

No.

No, it actually hadn't. Toiletries were missing. A suit was gone. So was some luggage. That's it.

No, not yet. As I said, we're not sure. But... basically no one has seen or heard anything.

It's just strange.  One day someone's walking around, going to work, alive, and then...

People just...disappear.

Eerie. Really eerie.

Isn't the Four Seasons a little far uptown? I mean aren't you going to be late?

Oh really? I didn't know that.

Don.

Uh, yes...I mean...whenever necessary. You know.

0h no. Informal conversations, mostly. What's that, Stoli?

Too true. You know, Bateman-people tend to reveal so much more about themselves when they're in a relaxed setting, don't you think?

Yeah, gone into rehab. Shame.  Is he a suspect?

God...I guess...I was probably returning videotapes.

Wait. That's not what I've got.

Let's see...  That you were with-

Well...When was the last time you were with Paul Owen?

Patrick, please. I hope I've been informative. Long day-a bit scattered.

Great, yes, I'd like that.

Absolutely. I'm with you on that one.

Not a big music fan, eh?

Well, to each his own. So-lunch, Thursday? I'll call your secretary about reservations.

Not in the mood, I guess.

But how? Where do you place Paul that night?

And?

Marcus?

But Marcus denied it?

Well, does Marcus have an alibi?

I checked it out. It's clean.

So who was he with?

Personally I think the guy went a little nutso. Split town for a while. Maybe he did go to London. Sightseeing. Drinking. Whatever. Anyway, I'm pretty sure he'll turn up sooner or later.  I mean, to think that one of his friends killed him, for no reason whatsoever would be too ridiculous. Isn't that right, Patrick?

It's cold out, too, isn't it?

Why don't you get a job? If you're so hungry, why don't you get a job?

Why? Were you drinking? Is that why you lost it? Insider trading? Just joking. No, really-were you drinking on the job?

I'm so hungry.

I'm not...

I'm hungry.

What am I gonna do?

Al.

Al.

Please...I don know what to do. I'm so cold.

I can't...I can't find a shelter

Oh well, you know.

Oh yes. I'm very lucky.

Yeah, well, you're late.

We should've gone to Dorsia. I could've gotten us a table.

I could tell you that, Halberstam, but then I'd have to kill you.

Cecelia is, well...you know 

Another Martini, Paul?

Two-hundred-and-fifty. Very reasonable. Let's leave a big tip, shall we? My place hr a nightcap?

Come on, you dumb son of a bitch.  I've got a preview of the Barneys catalogue and a bottle of Absolut waiting for us.

They're okay. BATEMAN Their early work was a little too New Wave for my taste. But then Sports came out in 1983, I think they really came into their own, commercially and artistically.

Yes, Owen?

No, Owen.

Yes, it is.

You'll look like you consciously worked for the look.

What shit? Now where do we have reservations at? I mean I'm not really hungry, but I would like to have reservations somewhere.

Some guys are just born cool, I guess.

They still have to give 'em refreshments laced with mind-altering drugs.

'Gonna wait outside.

"Make" him?

You know what he's like. He just wants to work on stuff that's cool.

C'mon, how often do you talk to somebody who's been on the cover of Time. Three of four times.

Then you've gotta ask him about that.

But he's not quite the same guy anymore. Don't get your hopes too high?

Didn't you visit the campus?

No way. You have this -- destiny.

Don't bring that up. Like a different girlfriend would'd've let you die?

Prob'ly waiting by the phone for Outpost to call. We'll leave it for him?

Milo! What about --?

That's what I need to ask you.  You know you can't keep anything from me.

What would it mean, anyway? If he didn't write it?

I know, I know.

Isn't that -- extreme?

You're right. It's -- a working relationship. Don't know what I was expecting.

Teddy was killed last night.

It was a hate crime.

I don't know what I'm saying. Maybe -- maybe they hired those guys.

I don't know! I just know it was Teddy's code. All these ideas flying in from everywhere. You know how he says "Any kid working in his garage can put us out of business?" It's like they know what every kid's doing.

"Like this?" It's Gary you're talking about.

Milo. Why would he --

Even if all this were true. There're 20 other buildings. All of them filled with computers and --

Milo, you told me those DOJ Agents are all over the place. How could they hope to hide a surveillance post?  And how can you get in there, anyway? With the cameras and the swipe cards --

You can't just walk in, either.

...Whaddo I do?

Nothing.

...Why?

Guilt?

Poor baby. You know that's not true.

What?

He has thousands of employees, Milo --

Milo --

Milo, you --

I went to see the Skywire model in Gary's office. You know. Just to hold it again.

Just shut up?

Yeah? Give me a goodbye kiss.

Don't we have any chopsticks?

Great.

It's gonna get cold.

You're just afraid to eat it.

No.

He'll tell me when he gets home.

Prick.

It's just -- I kind of feel the need to do something with my ability. Create something...

...It's -- Milo, isn't it?

Yeah. Hi. Thank you for seeing me.

I am. I am, sir.

My friend, my best friend, Teddy, was killed in Silicon Valley.

It was racially motivated. He's Chinese. He was. And... I know sometimes the FBI gets involved with that. Don't they?

I -- just wanna help bring these guys to justice. They're neo-Nazis.

'Just didn't know who else to talk to.

Yes sir.

'Thought if I relocated it could help my case. I'm writing programs for the local public access station. Where any whack-job with 100 bucks gets his own show? God, does it suck.  Can you help me?

'Forgot to introduce you.  I have a girlfriend.

You can't pre-empt Yoga, that's our biggest show.

What'd they ever do for you?

Great. Great! We need to drag a lot of heavy stuff in front of the door --

He's working backwards, too.  Let's do number five?

You should've called a few times to bug me about your job prospects.

Outpost was his baby, sure. On the other hand, we just learned Gary Boyd owns the Skywire satellites. Personally.

That'd change with a criminal indictment.

And the kid who wrote Skywire -- then gave it away? They're calling him the digital Robin Hood.

We tried!

He's pretty tight with his family.

He just likes to write code. He's bummed there's so much secrecy and competition, everybody trying to own everything.

I think they call him the "Houseman." 'Cause "guard" sounds too weird.

There's a rumor going around, maybe you've heard it.

Low enough to relay internet traffic.

It needs a more object-oriented language. This doesn't scale, does it?

...Do I?

That's insane. You're ahead of your time.

Take a look at this. Slightly different approach.

You're making me young again.

Well -- you sent for me.

What're you implying.

I'm sure.

Definitely.

Just once. 'Guess I was worried we didn't have anything to talk about, since work was off-limits. Non- disclosure.

Talk about work? Never!

Oh. Yeah.

The wrong place?

You look a little tired.

...My dad was a compulsive gambler. Only he didn't think he was. That applied to guys who didn't have a "system." "Losers," who played games of chance. He could "read" people, so chance had nothing to do with it. No matter how deep a hole he dug himself, he'd give you the whole speech. And you'd better not point out the obvious.  His creditors would catch up to him. Loan sharks or whatever. He'd wake us in the middle of the night. Off we'd go, again.

...Worse?

'Sorry about the late notice...

I couldn't do it at work cause of security or at home for -- obvious reasons.

I'm not much good at handwriting. Or parties.

You see what's hanging on the wall?

I do know, Gary. I feel the same way. I thought I was coming here for a job. But it's meant a lot more.

I do know. You focus on the big problem. But somewhere down the chain, something breaks down. Something gets destroyed. At first it's upsetting. You feel you've lost control.

'Start-up not 50 miles from here. Kid's on Prozac.

Nothing does. Still. I want him to like me.

Gary, don't worry, we --

Longitude 48 degrees 06 minutes --

Let's go.

Wait... He knows.

Just do it.

You do?

You are naive. Look at your employment contract: you can't work anywhere else in this field for at least few years.  Not that I don't miss you.

We'll come up with the next big thing.

Got out of my other commitment.

Cool.

Unlikely. All 14 cameras are frozen. Do we call Randy and Phil? Tell 'em there may have been a break-in?

Keep looking.

Any irregularity in the pattern.

Let's get him in here.

They know. 'Just they don't trust me with it. So we'll get the evidence, first, ask questions later.

I'm calling Gary.

Where we going?

I launched Skywire. Just pray the last set of coordinates Milo sent me connected us to Gary's satellite.

You know my name.

You're famous around here.

I wouldn't worry about it. You've gotta figure most people around here were their teachers' pets.

We moved around so much I barely knew my teachers.

...Something like that. Yeah.

No, I know what you mean. I used to spend my life wishing people could be like computers. Least they make sense. Sometimes you think they've betrayed you. Like a person would. But then you see, no, you just missed a step. You can go back and make it all work.

Graphical interfaces. For Skywire? I'm s'posed to coordinate with you.

Yeah? I ran it for lots of platforms, ranging from the narrowest bandwidth to --

No. Please.

You're compulsive.

Why's that?

Then and now.  But not right now.

She saved my life.

Why would you do a thing like --

The Day Care?

But why would they --?

They'd frame him.

They're already watching you. If they had to, they'd give him this drug that mimics an alcoholic blackout. He'd wake up not even remembering his "act of revenge."

Hmm?

They've got this guy in the DOJ, maybe others. We tell the wrong person, it's over.

There's always a logical answer -- you just have to define the question.

There're so many disinformation sites about Gary already. Where he has devil's horns or they crop him in with Saddam Hussein.

Right. But Gary's tied-in to a lot of media conglomerates. Have to be careful who we pick.

Certainly not at my happy home.

What about "60 Minutes."

Time-Warner has a 40 per cent stake in Gary's set-top device. That also takes out CNN.  "GE joins Outpost in new venture," which means NBC is out. "Disney joins Outpost," ABC is out. "Outpost and Newscorp in new deal," Fox is out. Any of these places could have a mole. Or all of 'em.  It's like a a continuous loop. We can go to some alternative press place that 1,000 people read, get them and us killed. But anything big enough for this is a parent of or a subsidiary to something Gary's got a finger in!

What?

A what?

But they'd still get the idea, right?

Before they kill somebody else, too.

You mean -- break in?

And what if the broadcast dishes on top of 21 aren't hot yet? You said the place isn't finished.

I thought the worst they would do is fire me. Who knew they took termination so literally?

Oh.  I liked you. I was checking you out.

'Cause their apartments might be bugged?

Gary.

The dishes are juiced up, too.

He doesn't know about the Day Care.

Yeah, that's old, in a tree.

Milo? What if Shrot notices somebody entered the Day Care at four A.M.? And tells them about it?

Perfect.  How am I gonna get away from the party long enough to --

That's lame, isn't it?

He suspects I know something. I think he was sort of -- explaining himself to me, in case I do.  We have to go in tonight. I'm two hours from a Beta version.  But I've gotta go home for an hour.

She called to apologize. I said I was pulling an all-nighter. She said then come home just to say Hi. Which I always do when we fight, it's suspicious if I don't.

At this point the worst thing I could do is anything out of the ordinary.

It's three years old, it --

But you said the other --

Let's try #2.

What?

Wait a second. He knows I know.

And your phone messages. You wanna do what you do, it's not a crime.

Hey, we got seed money for the startup! A million-five!

Outpost made me sign 1,000. 'Guess we'll find out what else we have to talk about. Life stuff.

What?!

No! I keep thinking it'll go away. But there's this -- connection. She's been hacking since she was little, she had to move around a lot. Plus I see her every day, we're working on the same program. She's -- beautiful.

What d'you mean?

What does that mean?

I didn't plan this.

Oh we're not going to the campus.

His Snapples were in alphabetical order.

She's a programmer?

#21. Way behind schedule. It's top- secret, but everybody knows it's a digital broadcast space. They see the dishes on top, the fiber optics going in.

You wanna survive in the software business, you cover your bets... I gotta say, this is the weirdest car anybody ever requested.

Can we buy into their IPO? Or is that a Justice Dept. problem?

Speaking of which...

Damn. 'Have to go back over there.  Be so much easier if we could walk in the front door.

Not much. Glorified cherry bomb. Right by the civil defense sign? Some geek's idea of irony. I been saying we need a camera in this hall.

Unless it's a diversion. Milo's in my office. He was tailgating, so I --

I could get it out of him.

Where is he?

Wait a second. I'm the one who found out he was mucking around in here in the first place.

I thought you'd quit while you were ahead.

You may.

Virtucon's main interest is in cable television, but they do have a subterranean construction division, yes. How did you know?

I'd rather talk about Number Two.

Or sometimes not at all.

Sak-i it to me!

That's very clever. Do you know any other poems?

Thank you, that's beautiful. To your health.

Kiss me.

Damn. What exactly do you do at Virtucon?

I think it was Wordsworth who penned this little gem: 'Press the button, pull the chain, out comes a chocolate choo-choo train.'

Hey, how are you?

Here, have this can of Campbell's Tomato Soup.

If you can become famous, everyone will have their fifteen minutes of fame, man.

We know all that, Exposition.

Dr. Evil? I thought I put him in jail for good.

Good luck, Austin.

Be careful.

You're in the Ministry of Defense. It's 1997. You've been cryogenically frozen for thirty years.

The shouting is a temporary side- effect of the unfreezing process.

You might also experience a slight fever, dry mouth, and flatulence at moments of extreme relaxation. Austin, this is Commander Gilmour, Strategic Command, and General Borschevsky, Russian Intelligence.

A lot's happened since you were frozen, Austin. The cold war's over.

We won, Austin.

Immediately. You'll be working with Ms. Kensington.

No, Austin, Mrs. Kensington has long- since retired. Ms.  Kensington is her daughter.

My God, Vanessa's got a smashing body. I bet she shags like a minx. How do I tell them that because of the unfreezing process, I have no inner monologue?  I hope I didn't say that out loud just now.

Thank you, Exposition.

Yes?

Thanks.

Thank you, Exposition.

Right away, Exposition.

Then you'll have to go it alone. Good luck.

Oh, and Austin...

What's the other?

What's the other thing you're scared of?

What?

Indeed... If we could get back to the business at hand. It's one thing to have a warhead, it's quite another thing to have the missiles to launch it.

Good God, and underground missile. We've long feared such a development.

Damn it, man! You're talking about my mother!

I think if everyone were honest, they'd confess that the lady looks exactly like a man in drag.

Yes, Basil?

Thanks.

I'd say that about sums it up, Exposition.

Austin, I have something for you as well.

Thanks, Basil. Maybe the Nineties aren't so bad after all.

Hey, Mick!

Well, you can't always get what you want.

Good on ya, man.

Well, Destructacon 5000, you have quite a head on your shoulders, I dare to coin.

Really? Let me ask you this. What is love?

Why not? It's a question.

No, Mr. Powers, I expect them to die. Even after they pay me the money, I'm still going to melt all the cities of the world with hot magma.  All right, guard, begin the unnecessarily Slow-Moving Dipping Mechanism.

Really, there's nothing more pathetic than an aging hipster.

Not really. Kill the little bastard. See what I care.

Well, as long as people are still having promiscuous sex with many anonymous partners without protection, while at the same time experimenting with mind-expanding drugs in a consequence-free environment, I'll be sound as a pound.

I went to Oxford and excelled in several subjects, but I ended up specializing in foreign languages. I wanted to travel -- see the world. In my last year I was accepted into the M.O.D. in the Cultural Studies sector. I thought I was off on an exciting career, but my job was to read everything printed in every country. It's very boring. My whole day is spent reading wedding announcements in Farsi. If I do well with this case, I finally get promoted to field operative...

I beg your pardon?

Excuse me?

I'm sorry?

Mr. Powers, please. I know that you must be a little confused, but we have a very serious situation at hand. I would appreciate it if you'd concentrate on our mission and give your libido a rest.

Sure.

What?

I hope this is part of the unfreezing process.

Yes, we've had it retrofitted with a secure cellular phone, an on-board computer, and a Global Geosynchronous Positioning Device. Oh, and finally, this.

I'm sure.

Here, use mine.

Oh, I forgot to tell you, they're prescription X-ray glasses. I have very bad astigmatism.

That cat Number Two has an X-ray eyepatch. I get bad vibes from him, man. Listen, we should go back to the room, but first I have to go to the naughty chair and see a man about a dog.

Do you want to talk to him?

Why?

Let me see.

How do you know?

He's too well-protected right now.

Let me tell you a story. There's these two bulls on top of a hill checking out some foxy cows in the meadow below. The young bull says, 'hey, why don't we run down the hill and shag us a cow?', and the wise old bull replies, 'no, why don't we walk down the hill and shag all the cows?'

Well, you know... cows, and shagging.

You're crazy. The camera loves you, Vanessa.

I couldn't have another bite.

Sorry. Move your hand to the left. There you go. Gorgeous.

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry that bug up your ass had to die.

No, this is me in a nutshell.

I am not.

I'm not. I'm the sensible one. I'm always the designated driver.

It's not that I'm drunk, I'm just beginning to see what my Mum was talking about.  What was my mother like back in the Sixties? I'm dying to know.

Look at her hands, baby! Those are carpenter's hands.

Of course, luv.

Don't be sorry. You're right to be suspicious. I shagged her. I shagged her rotten.

Of course, I had my nine-millimeter automatic.

Well they should, filthy beggars, they go from port to port.  Alotta meant nothing to me.

It was just a shag, Vanessa. You're everything to me.

Thirty years of political and social upheaval. The fall of the Berlin wall, a female Prime Minister of England, the abolishment of Apartheid, a fascinating tapestry of human strum und drang.

Basil was very concerned to know where you were last night.

Do you think she's prettier than I?

You know who.

I'm looking at you, and the whole time I can't help thinking you had your willie inside her hootchie-kooch.

Don't worry, baby. I picked up a mind control technique during my travels to India. I learned it from my guru, the late Guru Shastri, a chaste man who mysteriously died of a disease that had all the hallmarks of syphilis.  Just watch me. Watch me, now.

Yes, act naturally and we'll split this scene the way we came in, Vanessa.

Not now, Austin.

No, no, no. We'll use the floss to get to the ledge.

Indeed.

Yes.

We've got a freaked out square and world annihilation is his bag.  You go get help. I'm gonna stay here and keep an eye on the bad Doctor.

Listen, Vanessa, whatever happens, I just want you to know that I feel bad about shagging that Italian girl. I had a sip of sake and all of the sudden, I don't know what happened. The whole time I was shagging her-- I mean really shagging her, I mean it was crazy, I was like a huge mechanical piston, in and out, IN and OUT!--

Anyways, what I'm trying to say is that if you want me to be a one-woman man, well, that's just groovy, because... I love you.

Likewise.

I believe you, Austin. Let's go.

I'm going it alone this time, Vanessa. I have a follow-up visit with the Evil Doctor.

Lay it on me.

That's fab, because I love you, too, Vanessa.

Behave!

Actually, my name's Austin Powers.

That's not mine.

I'm telling you, baby, that's not mine.

I don't even know what this is. This sort of thing ain't my bag, baby.

Hey, wait a minute--

Here, have a piece of gum.

Hey! Wait a minute, that's my last piece of gum.

No, no, I want you to have it, even if it's my last piece.

Is it one of ours?

What are you saying, son?

That's a direct order. You didn't see a thing!

Can't you see I'm only half a man? Look at me, I'm a freak!

And look what you've done to Mr. Bigglesworth!

Silence!

Let this be a reminder to you all that this organization will not tolerate failure.

Someone help me! I'm still alive, only I'm very badly burned.

Hello up there! Anyone! Can someone call an ambulance? I'm in quite a lot of pain.

Right. Okay. Moving on.

Yes.

Ya wohl-- I mean, yes wohl, Herr Doctor. I have created the ultimate weapon to defeat Austin Powers. Bring on the Fembots!

These are the latest word in android replicant technology.  Lethal, efficient, brutal. And no man can resist their charms. Send in the soldiers!

Thank you, Herr Doctor.

Dr. Evil?

It's about the sharks. Since you were frozen, they've been placed on the Endangered Species List. We tried to get some, but it will take months to clear up the red tape.

Well, we experimented with lasers, but you would be surprised at how heavy they are. They actually outweighed the piranha themselves, and the fish, well, they sank to the bottom and died.

Sea bass.

Don't be so hard on yourself. You're here, that's what's important. A journey of a thousand miles begins with one step.

That's not true, Doctor. Please, tell us about your childhood.

Hello, Scott. I'm your father, Dr. Evil.  I have a son! I have a son! Everyone, I have a son!  Someday, Scott, this will all be yours.

No. Maybe, like, work in a petting zoo or something.

You always do that!  Anyways, this is really hard, because, you know, my Dad is really evil.

Thought I'd stay in. There's a good tittie movie on Skinemax.

Yeah. What?

Why are you feeding him? Why don't you just kill him?

But what if he escapes? Why don't you just shoot him? What are you waiting for?

Aren't you going to watch them? They'll get away!

I have a gun in my room. Give me five seconds, I'll come back and blow their brains out.

I don't want to.

Blow me.

Show me.

I had the group liquidated, you little shit. They were insolent.

Scott, don't say that...

Gentlemen, I have a plan. It's called blackmail. The Royal Family of Britain are the wealthiest landowners in the world. Either the Royal Family pays us an exorbitant amount of money, or we make it look like Prince Charles, the heir to the throne, has had an affair outside of marriage and, therefore, they would have to divorce.

People have to tell me these things. I've been frozen for thirty years, throw me a bone here.  OK, no problem. Here's my second plan. Back in the Sixties I had a weather changing machine that was in essence a sophisticated heat beam which we called a "laser."  Using this laser, we punch a hole in the protective layer around the Earth, which we scientists call the "Ozone Layer." Slowly but surely, ultraviolet rays would pour in, increasing the risk of skin cancer. That is, unless the world pays us a hefty ransom.

Right.  Oh, hell, let's just do what we always do. Let's hijack some nuclear weapons and hold the world hostage.  Gentlemen, it's come to my attention that a breakaway Russian Republic called Kreplachistan will be transferring a nuclear warhead to the United Nations in a few days. Here's the plan. We get the warhead, and we hold the world ransom...  ...FOR ONE MILLION DOLLARS!

Oh, really?  One-hundred billion dollars.  OK, make it happen. Anything else?

Great.

He's asleep.

Oh, God no, I made him sleep on the couch.

Why?

You can't judge him by modern standards. He's very much a product of his times. In my day he could have any woman he wanted.

You have to understand, in Britain in the Sixties you could be a sex symbol and still have bad teeth. It didn't matter.

Austin is very charming, very debonair. He's handsome, witty, has a knowledge of fine wines, sophisticated, a world-renowned photographer. Women want him, men want to be him. He's a lover of love-- every bit an International Man of Mystery.

I know. Let me just say this: Austin was the most loyal and caring friend I ever had.

Well, it's kind of weird.

OK. Well, I just really met my Dad for the first time three days ago. He was partially frozen for thirty years. I never knew him growing up. He comes back and now he wants me to take over the family business.

I don't wanna take over the family business.

I don't know. I was thinking, maybe I'd be a vet or something, cause I like animals and stuff.

OK, Scott, no one really wants to "kill" anyone here. They say it, but they don't mean it.

Shame. I was recommended. By a friend.

You don't say. How real does it feel?

There are limits?

No need. I'll call again.

... bottle ...

... head ...

... power ...

... preserve...

... love...

... love ...

Three days.

Ah, but you haven't see the real me. Watch closely ...

You don't get rain like you used to in England. A good shower that's the ticket. Stiffens resolve, puckers the spirit, quells the namby-pamby in a man.

Have we met?

Promised? Who promised?

Sir August...?  What now?

Impossible?

As you see.

I have an appointment.

Really -- what happened in 1922?

If nature gives a man a collector's mind, it doesn't matter what he collects. Butterflies. Old China. Penny farthings. A true collector grows more obsessive as the years pass.

We have met ...

Rules are made to be broken.

Then who wins?

Hmmm ...

Let me guess -- 'Father'?

Something strange is happening. And whoever knows about it doesn't want us to find out.

He tried to warn us ...

Directed by laser. Bounced by satellite. Quite possible.

After the cold war ...

You need treatment, Mrs. Peel.  You can't resign.

We want to help...!

The death of Peter Peel was a great loss. To us all ...

The Institute ... the funding ...

Quite frankly ... it could have been you.

To find out who killed my husband.

So am I.

Next assignment?

Thank you, Steed.

Thanks, Valentine ...

Darling Emma -- yes, we:  the true genius behind the Prospero Project ...

Dr. Darling, Peter ... all you ...

You killed my husband.

Too many cooks --

But I found you. All the clues led me here ...

But -- why?

'Our revels now are ended.'

I'm already married ...

Valentine, listen to me ...

Ring?

Destruction of their local weather systems. I can zap a thousand Chernobyls into the air.

Chaos. Transport paralysis. Crop failure.  Economic disaster. Frostbite or sunburn ... on a massive scale. You've seen a few samples...

One very small thing. A diamond 'cyclone' chip. A thousand times more information on a fraction of the size. If I possess that, my powers would be unlimited. My dear half-brother was developing it. But he suspected sabotage. He gave the chip to ... you, 'Mrs.' Peel. I want you. But also your ring.

How Wagnerian ... Do you mean to say you've waited all these years because you couldn't create a chip on your own? That would have amused Peter.

What are my choices?

I'll never marry you.

And you must be Steed. Please don't get up.

I had a spot of bother at the door.

1922. Why the kippers?

So what was all this -- some sort of test?

Whereas you are.

Rules are made to be broken.

And just what is the game?

Under the circumstances, you may call me Mrs. Peel.

And now that we've settled the matter of honorifics, will you kindly explain why you wished me to meet you?

Mother?

We're not here to talk about the weather, surely.

A kipper. Or a red herring? What were they investigating?

Yes indeed. I need protection.

Oh, absolutely, but Trubshaw's a man worth meeting. No point setting out half shod.

Thank you, Trubshaw ...

Do you really think so?

Not all Tradition is bad, Mrs. Peel. No thank you.

A Gentleman has to have a code. This is part of mine. A uniform. Think of it as my suit of shining armor.

The most unpredictable piece on the board. And always ready to protect his queen.

As per mother's instructions.

For a man in my position --

They call me in when they've reached a dead end. Freelance. Like yourself.

I meant me.

June, July ... August?

Any other vices?

Small talk.  Try the weather.

You should be dead.  How do you feel?

You were very lucky.  Four shots to the heart. I found you after I slipped away from Sir August. Mother brought you here. Not me you should thank.

I mean your man Trubshaw.  Your bullet-proof waistcoat.  I thought you were just overdressed.

Why should they think that?

Frankly that's how I remember it.

Perhaps your memory plays tricks, Mrs. Peel.

Did he say who?

Did you say formal? I must dress.

You mean my other self ...

I should have thought that was obvious ...  I'm in mourning.

How on earth can you tell?

Very good, Steed ...

Any ideas?

Is that written in his shoe?

She had this in her mouth. There, there...

Don't bother.  Here's a bus ...

Is there anything that isn't?

But if someone miniaturized the process...

Sounds as if someone's hijacked your research.

... And by you, Mrs. Peel ...

... And by you, Mrs. Peel. Everything points to you.  No sisters?  No undiscovered twin?

Oh, well ...  Just my type, Mrs. Peel.

Here's the one that broke the camel's back.

I expect we'll have to gatecrash.

Mrs. Peel ... ?

The Winslow Home for Retired Lepidoptorists. I'm so sorry I struck you, Mrs. Peel. Please forgive me. I thought you were someone else ...

I expect that's for you to know and me to find out ...

Orders.

No trouble.

Always.  Except ...

... when I don't. It comes down to one thing, Mrs. Peel. Trust.

I could be convinced, if ... I knew who poisoned me in the maze. That kiss ...

Keeping a stiff upper lip?

Not for a moment.

Aren't we all, Mrs. Peel?

I thought you didn't.

After you -- Mrs. Peel ...

You don't trust me?

You lied.

No idea who. No idea why ...

... Or grown-ups, who still like to be children.

Not to speak of. Peter and I were both loners. There was nobody.

I'm a wanted woman, I know ...

Why's he called 'Invisible'?

I'll catch you up. Don't worry; he's expecting you.

Hurry?  What for?  I'm just now --

Have we been invited?

Limpet bomb. Small, very compact. From Trubshaw's.

You first.

Snuff.  I must insist you try some.

'The Merry Widow?' I might have known. Where's the reception?

Have a look at this.

Where are you going?

If you'd been through what I have, you wouldn't --

Still a bit chilly ...

Have you any place in mind?

It's the latest thing, Mrs. Peel.

Not quite.

Must be. Trubshaw's busy. I'll send Mother ...

I'm no spy -- where do I fit in?

Mobile HQ. In a blue funk.  Can't take chances. I'm looking after things while he's hiding out ...

It's Mother you have to convince. He's very agitated.  Wait here.

Peter's brother?  But --

I know all this.

Surveillance? By whom?

Who's now vanished.

Are you suggesting that Dr. Darling and Valentine were somehow in this together? But that's absurd.

Getting to what?

I fail to see --

... and now?

Let me guess:  Wonderland Weather.

I shall need a small plane.

We want Mrs. Peel.

How did you guess?

It was you who gave Valentine Peel his security clearance ... you're the mole who betrayed the Ministry.

Well, you found me. Have a sniff of this, why don't you? Careful, the scent can be overpowering ...

Perhaps I'd better start calling you doctor again, Mrs. Peel --

She may not know. Theory goes she may be very ill.

Possibly. Split personality ...

She may try to kill you.

How come you took so much interest in her, Dr. Darling?

Anyone particular in mind?

No. Her husband, she says. Alice tried to warn us. A trap. Tell Mother beware. Tell Father That's all.

You're getting yourself into terrible trouble, my son. Weather's turning very nasty -- and so am I.

Where?

I'm warning you for the last time, Steed: whoever's behind all this, looks like Mrs. Peel, walks like Mrs. Peel and kills like Mrs. Peel.

I think so, thank you so much ...

I feel sure of it.

She was ...

Both, actually.

You don't say.  Like looking for a needle in a ...

This way ...

Ask not for whom the telephone rings ...

Walk over to the window ...

Stay by the window. By the window.

Valentine Peel. I see you've gone back to using your original face.

Perish the thought.

I was at Harrow ...

You wish.

If you say so.

Did I? My mistake.

You are, and it's behind you.

Ugh ...

Debbie's marrying Rick.

Really -- you went with him for two years.

Deb, I want to throw you a shower.

Check out the other guy's buns.

Bobbie, what are you talking about?

He's not gonna be happy. And your parents can't be too thrilled either.

They'll probably get drunk, and watch dirty movies. But don't worry about the dirty movies.

I forgot to tell you. Yesterday I found a bunch of pornos in the back seat of O'Neill's car.

Nah. Everything's cool... I took care of 'em. 

I feel like I'm spying on Rick.

Right in here. The big show starts in one minute.

Rick's got an important announcement to make.

You're kidding.

Yeah. Right. All the things that make life worth living.

Chulo, one thing at a time.

We're going for a little liquid refreshment.

Too bad, man, that blows my chance to be Ambassador to France.

Okay... This is it... I'm getting married.

Hey, man, congratulations!

Yeah, man, he's got us a great room at the hotel and lots of chicks.

What time are we supposed to get to the hotel?

When do the girls get to the party?

I'd like to jerk and press those babies.

Bond... James Bond.

I want Debbie.

You dump her and I'll give you cash.

Five thousand dollars.

I'm marrying Debbie.

What is this person's story here?

He's gonna hurt you, Debbie. He'll never be true to you the way I would.

Ah, Cole.  I don't remember ordering an asshole from room service.

Oh, come on, just a little.

The best.

I'm very happy for you two.

The car for Debbie?

Gee, guys, what should I do? The car or Debbie?

So does Debbie.

Maybe it had something to do.

She's mine!

Fan out and look for them.

Mr. Thomerson.

Yes I did.

Not so good. He wouldn't listen to reason. He stole my car... my Porsche... I can't find it anywhere...

Not at all. We're just finishing lunch.

Thank you, sir.

Yes, sir, I am.

I've tried to change her mind.

Keep me informed.

What? I'm sorry, sir, I can't hear you.

Sorry, I can't hear you. Some pin head's yelling...  Shut up, I'm talking here.  Now look, I want you to go back and I don't care what you do. Stop that marriage.

The bachelor party's upstairs. They made me get naked. They hung me from the window so high up it was so scary I fell down...

1002.

Yes, sir.

Over here, Deb... in the Smokehouse.

It's all right, I forgive you. I'm not the vengeful type. We'll forget what happened. Why don't we take a trip together? Maybe kill a few lions in Kenya over Christmas.

You know, when you dumped me for that wimp, I thought, Cole, she'll be back. God wants the two of you to be together, and sure enough...

You're marrying him? Then why are you coming back to me?

I'm going now, Cole.

It's either meatloaf, Swiss steak or charred flesh. I won't know till it's finished.

You're going to have a bachelor party?

It looks awful.

Are you going to have women at your party?

Because from what I've heard, it's a tradition and you're a traditional guy.

I can't sleep.

What's the matter?

About what?

I think the only think you've left out are our relations with the Soviet Union. Sweetheart, everything's gonna be all right.

C'mere.

Good...

Now, I want you to lie down and drift off to slumberland.

Gonna get married...

Can't I just go with you guys?

Did I promise that? I don't remember that...

Your mother's not dead.

How wonderful. A seeing eye hooker.

C'mon, I knew it was you.

Debbie, I'm telling you, I didn't do anything, hardly.

I don't want that. I want to be with you.

I am committed. I love you.

Yes...

Yeah.

You're so romantic...

Ilene, why would I want to do that? I trust Rick.

Ilene, Rick promised...

Look, you heard what those hookers said. They were supposed to go to a bachelor party.

Debbie, men are pigs -- if they can have women, we can have men.

Look, girls -- I'll stay behind and hold them off. The rest of you break for it!

Great, Mom.

You know your father enjoys his company.

Ilene, we don't really know that.

I hope those guys are all right.

My pleasure, Al... Always happy to help out in a pinch...  Excuse me. I better call my service... tell them where I am.

A real turd.

I think I screwed that one once.

Any time, Al.

They'll be up there in a half hour.

What are you talking about, asshole?

They left an hour ago, pink nuts.

What are you...

Why?

Hey. I'm sorry. You want girls. I'll give you girls.

That's more like it.

Gary, you're quite an animal.

Isn't he incredible, gets along with everybody.

Because I love her. What can I tell you?

Let's have a toast.

What's going on?

This place should have been wall to wall tits by now.

I'm going to see what the hell happened.

Screw that.

Yes.

You're a pimp?

I'll take some.

Sold. 45 minutes. No problem.

Milt?

Just in love with everybody. It's really a beautiful planet. I love you, Rick. I love you guys. I love everybody.

Naw, two on a Quaalude... bad luck.

Maybe your marriage should lay off grains for a while.

What do you mean, it changes?

C'mon, Larry. Be good for you.

All right. Now, there's milk and cookies in the refrigerator. Go to bed right after "Falcon Crest."

No, she hates me... I want to end everything here... now.

Yeah. I see you're right. C'mon, let's party.

I'm trying to slash my wrists.

I couldn't find any razor blades.

Ha, ha, ha.

It's really not all your fault. I was talking to Mike earlier and he had a lot of problems. Personal things, you know. Made some bad investments. At least now he's peaceful...

What do you know, they moved it. Catch you later.

All right, who serves?

Can't I just maim it a little?

Rick, I want to cut through the b.s.

Good. I think you're an asshole. No, let me correct that, an immature asshole. Which is fine, except you're marrying my daughter and I'm afraid my grandchildren are going to be little assholes.

Rick!

Of course, sir. That explains it. Leather is a very good source of vitamin E.

No. Let's at least finish the set.

In a second...  And you're irresponsible. Show some initiative, try to better yourself, stop showing off, actions speak louder than words.

You can tell a man by his friends.

No, Brett, I...

Of course.

Knowing Larry, he probably missed the flight.

Olivier's in that, right?

Hey, I'm starved... Let's go get something to eat. We'll bring back food for everybody.

C'mon. I insist.

My gift to you.

The best table in the house.

I don't know. Maybe it's because I love Debbie or maybe it's hard for me to get off in a place that smells like egg salad. I'm not sure.

Oooooo.

If I'm not out in a half hour, send for the paramedics.

Put it to you this way -- you're gonna have to pry her out of the bed with a spatula, mister.

I don't know.

Got me.

Still drawing a blank.

Very.

Take care.

Who's your friend?

What can I do? I'm dead. Debbie's going to go crazy and end the whole thing.

I'm saved. Let's party!

Who?

My Debbie?

You got it.

Rick, marriage will be good for you. It's done wonders for me.

You won't miss a thing about being single... The wild parties, the different girls every night, running around like a maniac... God, I miss that.

Okay, Rick, all finished. I can't wait for that bachelor party... I need the action.

Right. Give me the will to live. Let me go first.

Nah, not yet. Look, you're my older brother. I need some advice here. What's the deal with marriage? What can I expect?

Great.  I was wondering, how do you guys go to the bathroom in that thing?

I know, Sister, but I have a very good excuse.

Maybe I did... I don't remember.

Yeah. Who'd have thought they'd both be a size 138 regular.

Be gentle.

Tim, fill out the alarm card.  Clean the pipe poles, wipe down the ladders and hang some hose.

No.  I need a drink.

Yeah...

We're gonna be okay, man...

It isn't safe, man. Don't go splittin' us up. Not with this one.

Let me take the lead, Stephen...

-- You can't let him turn you against your friends, man --

There's a fire. We've got a job here. Let's get on with it.

Stevie... I...

My Lt. might have something to say about that.

John, when you're in there... in the fire... do you ever see...

He's alive.

Just come down, John. Just --

-- You know what Swayzak would do to the department if this got out? --

-- What he would do to your dad's department? You gotta let me finish it --

Who asked you?

I want to thank you for coming to my graduation, Stephen. It was a great inspiration to me.

Not likely.

It's comin' along... want a beer?

It's old stuff Adcox gave me that the department was going to throw out anyway. Still good enough though for this tub.

What, you've never seen one before?

Millions, Stephen -- And sexual favors.

Yeah? What about Laura --

I wanted to know why you messed with my station assignment. I mean, is this really gonna have to one of those big brother -- little brother "you broke my GI Joe and I'm still pissed" games?

Hey! You don't know me --

So that's it? Big bad brother's gonna ride my ass till I cough blood?

Yeah, you know. You know what it felt like.

I think you're gonna find out, Brian. Don't be late tomorrow.

What you did was drop the ball, Probie. Get that right.

-- Never mind.

Brian --  -- See ya tonight.

Hey.

Nah, he's nothin'. It's just sometimes... sometimes you just gotta punch somebody out, y'know?

C'mon, let's crawl home.

What, are you kidding? By myself?

You got a problem with drilling, probie?

Roll the hose.

Christ, Stephen, let's wait for the hose team...

I waited... I would have fucking waited...

Thanks for the insight.

Had to take on another fire bare- handed, huh? Had to be fucking myth man in there instead of looking out for your probie. Is that what happened? Is it, Stephen?

He didn't listen? He was a fucking candidate! He was your responsibility. He shouldn't have been there in the first place, Stephen.  You burned him.

Just... Just wanted to say hello...

You're selling dad's boat?

I really should get back. There's... there's something I'm supposed to do.

Look, Stephen, maybe we can talk about this some other --

-- I tried, y'know? Helen's right. I don't have all the answers, but goddamn it, I've got some.  Look, you're gonna do what you have to, and maybe I shouldn't have gotten in the way. I'm your brother, not your father. Go on. You gotta go somewhere? Go...

Saw what?

Everybody did.

...Jesus, you been carrying that around for twenty years? For christ's sake, you were seven years old! You think he could have heard you in there?

Maybe I do.  ...What a fuckin' mess, huh?  People can change Brian.

I don't know, Brian... I don't know...

-- What are you doing here?

I know.

I knew when you came looking for the chemicals. Looking for me.

They were for the fucking boat, Brian.

What are we going to do about this?

We gotta go to Rimgale, Stephen.

Shut up!

"You never know till the fire stares you down if you're gonna be --"

I'm sorry... I'm sorry I thought... I won't.

Jennifer.

You look great.

Uh... I've been sorta keeping a low profile... the academy... I graduated today.

So... I see you're still in the neighborhood.

Yeah? What have you been up to?

Really? No kidding.

I don't want to be your friend, Brian.

When I was twenty.

Yeah. Swayzak. Humanity's last hope. How can you work for that guy?

-- All I know is that his programs are getting firemen hurt.

Yeah, well I like to think I'm just a little past hanging out on JP II watching the Irish pick fights and Litwalks barf in the planters.

C'mon Jennifer, he's just another North-Side jag-off with a mouth.

So now you suddenly care about my future?

Hey, sorry if I made you look bad in front of your boss. But I'm not gonna be a poster boy for him, I'm trying to do something here. There's five hundred smoke eaters in this room that do that stuff for real every day. Tell Swayzak to talk to one of them.

Straightest answer your department's given me all week.

How's it going?

Yeah? Well, maybe I can fit it in...

Hey...  So are you dating your boss or what?

Sorry.  Are you dating anyone?

Well, you did invite me here.

Yeah, but it doesn't take Albert Einstein just to figure out if these guys were killed by accidents or not.

But Rimgale's probably going to come around to arson.

Do you miss it?  You seem like you do.

Then why did you quit?

You told Swayzak about our arson lead. It's all over the fucking news.

-- You could have scared the son of a bitch off. We may never bust him now. All for a couple's political points.

Yeah? And just how much of all this has been "doing your job"?

-- I work for the city.

Swayzak knows something about the guys that were murdered. I want to know why he keeps that hidden.

You could check. It'd be in his files.

Yes.

Your boss is lying, Jennifer.

Just take it.

That's a dumb thing to say.

I quit two days ago, Brian.

I don't have the slightest idea...

Hey, do I know you?

Who's doing this?

Then who --

I don't have a story.

I... I thought it was great. I loved it. It was nothing to these guys... medium deal.

Trychticholorate.

After it took your dad... the fire... did it look at you Brian? Did it talk to you?...

Look, everybody remembers your old man. Being his son, all you had to do was breathe to graduate here. Dead Hero Father Rule. But you blew us off. Why should I take you back?

Sorry, but it's out of my hands. Try again next year.

Your Dennis' kid.  I work alone.

Get used to me, Inspector. I'm not going anywhere.

I think we should get something straight here. I was assigned to this office by the city.

What are you listening to?

Glass?

-- Another backdraft.

No it couldn't.

I just re-wrote your contract. C'mere...

"Trychtichlorate is a binary structured --"

"During heat episodes of 2000 Kelvin or higher, Trych breaks down and dissipates. Will consume magnesium".

Trychticholorate. Then Swayzak can announce Seagrave was a murder.

And the putty around the door?

But the right guess on this is arson.

Some people say you don't do much of anything when it comes to this case.

What?

But he killed these guys.

What reason?

Are you going public with this?

I'm finished with Swayzak. I'll do whatever you want me to do. I just want to help catch the guy that burned Tim. You gotta give me another shot.

Son of a bitch. They knew each other.

And Cosgrove. Coppers figured he laundered money for the mob before getting into real estate. They weren't very high on Seagrave, either.

Yeah? Airtight?

Did a little check on the consulting firm that wrote the report. They did exactly one job -- Swayzak's manpower study. It's not even really a company. No employees, no directors, just a PO Box.

How ya feeling?

Yeah.

No.

I hate hospitals. You're so... so goddamn useless...

I've been lying here hours... just thinking... We're close...  We're not looking in the right place, Brian. This one knows us and we're not looking in the right place...

Yeah.

Like it never happened...

Hi, Helen. Man, you look great.

I know, I know, Should'a called. I've been really busy. I joined the fire department.

Yeah, you'd be surprised what three years can do to a kid.

You guys ought to try picking up a phone once in awhile.

And I'm a huge fan of what you did to save that woman, Brian.

No need to be modest, Brian.

-- That really was incredibly work you did. You and your brother, fighting fires together, helluva image, isn't it? You must feel lucky to be assigned under his command.

This one's still with the fire department. One of our best investigators, Don Rimgale, is working on a very difficult, visible case right now. We think he could use another pair of hands and you're exactly the kind of guy I want representing us: An authentic hero from a traditional firefighting clan.

Nice boat.

Yeah. In fact, I just dropped off a letter to the Times explaining how yesterday's arson announcement was a fabrication by your office. They loved it. And you know what? You were right, my family background in firefighting gave it weight.

What the hell are we waiting for?

Engine 115, right?

Lucky guess.  And a case of scotch to a captain in station assignments.

Lots of fires. They promote faster there. Take a look at the last Lt.'s list, half the guys on it came from that battalion. Gotta think about your future, Timmy. 115's the station.

Backdraft.

Could you believe that fire? Man! First day! There I was, Adcox and me, pullin' that lady right out of the fire's fuckin' throat! I love it here -- No surround and drown for this company. Fighting 17th! Goddamn Stephen's amazing. You see how he took that fire by the balls? I'm gonna be that good some day, you watch.

Ah man, is he usin' that line now on you? What, you think he made that little gem up? Jesus Christ, I used to have to listen to my old man use that every morning.

"Probationary Fireman Brian McCaffrey, on his very first fire, showed the kind of bravery and courage of a veteran firefighter when he risked life and limb to double-check a burning floor alone, emerging victoriously with Anna Rodriguez, a seamstress for the North Shore Clothing Company... McCaffrey first gained prominence as the subject of a 1972 Pulitzer Prize winning photograph taken at the scene of his father's death..."

There's no replacement 'cause of your boss' cuts, if that's what you mean. If someone else goes out on an injury we're really screwed.

It's in my blood, Willy.

Didn't offer the kinda growth and challenge I need.

Management were pin heads.

Coffee sucked.

I was ahead of my time.

Brian. He's not doing it right, dad. He never does it right.

Hey, what's with the mouth? Where'd you grow up, a barn?

Cute.

You've come along a dozen times, Stephen, give your brother a chance. We'll be back in a few minutes.  How 'bout it, sport?

Call in another alarm. We're gonna need some back-up.

I'm busy.

-- I'm busy goddamn it, okay?

I'll be there.

I'll be there, goddamn it!

Stephen, I'm kinda busy here, can we talk about this later?

Here we go...

Fixing my roof.

He's got piano lessons.

He's going to be a fireman.

Stephen, you gotta stop just showing up on the roof like this.

-- You remember.

He deserved it. He was born deserving it.

Okay.

You treated me like shit.

He's out.

Hey, I'm the first one to admit when I'm wrong.

In a fire? Never.  Look, I'm his brother. I care about him, y'know? He was going to get himself killed. Maybe not today, maybe not in a year, but it would've happened. And I couldn't -- I just couldn't...

What's wrong?

Stephen... I... can I talk to you a second...

-- No, that's okay. It's just Sean...

I don't want to confuse him, Stephen.

Putty? On both doors?

McCaffrey, hold this for us.

Trychticholorate? Alright, it's an absorption catalyst in toxic waste accidents. It's pretty rare, they stopped making it a couple'a years ago.

What the hell was it doing in the fire?

How ya doin', Ronald. Staying comfortable?

Wouldn't miss this for the world, pal.

He works for me.

You like everybody, Ronald.

I know you.

Tell him about me, Shadow?

Did he tell you how we finally met?

Oh, but it's a good story, Shadow. You're depriving our famous young friend here...

And old ladies?

I deal with this stuff every day. But a fireman... you never get used to it.  What happened up there? He was a candidate. Did he pay attention? Was he listening?

I might.

Investigator Rimgale.

Alderman.

"Don?"

Jesus, open your eyes! Seagrave, Cosgrove, and now Holcomb -- fried in a goddamn high-rise!

Just catch the son of a bitch.

Investigator...

This'll only take a minute. There's two cops outside that want to ask you about this --

Who said anything about the fucking street. I've got more connects than you have, Lieutenant...

They're alive, aren't they? Come on, man! Everyone's making such a fucking fuss, just because she's a nun. Just because she wears a penguin suit, the church puts up 50 G for the guys who dared to rape her. Do you think they'd put up a dime if you got raped? Of course not. Or even for your little sister? The virgin? Like shit they would.

She's fucking nine years old! Jesus Christ.

Yeah? At least she's alive! I see people get killed every day! Worse yet, tortured first and then killed! The nuns got off easy. Jeez. Cigarette burns. Everyone's all upset about fucking cigarette burns. I'll show you cigarette burns!

I'm not talking about the fucking Church. Fuck the Church. But tell me. Do you believe in God?

That Jesus Christ was the Son of God and he came to die for your sins.

You believe that man is the be-all and end-all?

OK. OK. Fine. But -- do you believe in God?

Why?

Who?

Yeah.

Nah...

Who?

You mean you could use it.

"The Strawberries"?

I'm a Catholic.

Yes.

I was gonna bring it back myself.

He wants to know who brought in the chalice.

Fuck you.  Just give me back a little something for the road.

Very good. Very good. The Mets are gonna win tomorrow.

Uh - right. Sure. The Mets are gonna win tomorrow.

Me?

You can't forgive me. After what I've done.  I've fucked up bigtime. I've been bad. Real bad.

Please. Please don't forgive me. I've always hated you for that.

Why? Why can't you hate me? Hate me! Please! Help me!  Hate me! Help me! Hate me!

Why? Jesus! Why me? Why can't I wash the ashes from my forehead, year after year after year? And why am I still drunk on your blood, the taste of your flesh on my tongue? Worst of all, why can't I feel the nails in my palms, the spear in my side, the crown of thorns round my head? Why do I have to know, over and over, that it was you. You who died; died for my sins! And that I will die for nothing. Why?

I forgive you.

All right, cop. I want my money.

Let me think about it.

Yeah, really. I'm no fucking asshole, man. I'm a fucking cop!

Yeah, sucker. You better be there!

How about 7 1/2?

Are you sure?

I wanna go double or nothing on the next game.

I'm not gonna let that bastard take my money

There's just no way the Mets will lose this game. Gooden is pitching and Strawberry is ready to break out.

What money?

This psycho can.

You're a fucking joke, you know that?  He's been waiting for the money since the fucking game ended. And I've been waiting here since -- forget it. Listen up. You're gonna get us both fucking killed. You know that!

Good. I'll give him an extra 10 grand for his trouble. I hate that motherfucking house and --

I've been dodging bullets since I was fourteen. No one can kill me. I'm fucking blessed. I'm fucking Catholic.

What case?

Yeah. Sure. Yeah. We're on it bigtime. Lots of leads. You bet.

Here. Look I'll give you the psyho's number You call him yourself and tell him wnat you want.

Sister, we all know what happened to you yesterday morning. I expected that you would want to speak to me about it. But you could have come to my office. Your being here, in the confessional, implies that you, Sister, have done something wrong. You haven't. I assure you. I feared you might have misplaced feelings of guilt. If you condemn yourself because you experienced feelings of... curiosity or even... pleasure, you mustn't --

It's funny, you knew. But the first thing I think of is kneading the bread that I help bake for the soup kitchen. Maybe that's because my the muscles in my arms still hurt.

Yes, Sister?

You knew them?  Who were they, Sister? Who are these boys? What are the names of these -- good boys you knew?

How 'bout...

B-L-A-K it is.

I'm on it.

...that simpleton is holding back the race.  They got rid of us and keep those two buffoons, Mantan and Sleep 'N Eat, y'knowwhatI'msayin'?

We know.  We know.  Yo, check it, my black brothers, we can't let this slide.  Not this injustice. Nah, no way.  Dem' two real coons iz ill.

Did he gots to be.

Ho!

Yeah!

Let's go NIGGERS.

Louder.  They can't hear you.

I didn't mean to scare you like that.

Whoa, hold up li'l sis'.  I done told you 'bout that.  Julius ain't my name, you better recognize Hopkins was our slave name.  My true name is...

BIG BLACK is the first name and AFRICA is the last.

I order out mostly.  So what do I owe this visit to?

Who are you revolting against?

Please.

Delacroix.

What makes you think he would write a show about the Mau-Mau's.

So are you telling me that you wouldn't even introduce me to Delacroix or set up a meeting?  I'm talking 'bout me, your only brother, ya own flesh and blood, hook a brother up, youknowwhatI'msayin'.

There is a name, a term for your kind, the likes of you.  Back in slavery days, you would be classified as a house nigga.

My own sister throwin' me out.  I hope to seeya later when you get ya mind right.  Don't bother letting me out.

What's your name?

And what are the Mau-Mau's going to do for us today?

What do I do?

I'm a revolutionary.

Ladies and gentlemen, there is no need to go there.  We can all agree to disagree without making threats.

You might be right.

Naw, not you.  It can't be.  That hottie Sloan Hopkins.

No shame in ya game.  She got ya nostrils, ya chnoz is wide open. Sloan's what we certified ladies' men call low hanging fruit.

Moorish.  Ya get a little taste of dat booty, ya wanna get some MORE.

Sloan is all 'dat.  I try her.  I'm a tri-sexual.

Naw, just jokin'.  That's you. That's you.

You ain't happy about the green light?

Must be the pressure.

Look at my lips.

What are you talkin' about?

Damn skippy.

Don't shoot me, I'm just the piano players.

Yeah, that's easy for you to do. You never had any talent.

Good morning to you, Mr. Delapot.

Y'know what I mean.  Got a gig yet for Manray and I yet?

You'd take no offense if we called you DeLa for short?

Manray needs a job.

How much?

Different.

You'll both get an advance and you can stay with me.

And this is Manray.

We might need some mo' money behind this.

My world famous, famous world Arroz con pollo will be ready very soon.

Did we get our bill yet?

Yo, check it.  This is good and all that but one day soon I want to have much Benjamins so I can have a nice crib and pay all my bills. You hear me.

I'm tired of waiting.

Are you crazy?  The joint is crawling with cops now.  You wanna go to Rikers?  Go to the hoosegow?

We was coming to see you.

We're starving.

DeLa, I don't know 'bout this.

Well do something about it.

EUREKA!!

Trust me.  Of course I still have to pitch it to my boss, but we'll have an answer one way or the other.

That's right.  Money turns the wheel.

To what?

Mantan?  I don't even care as long as I'm dancing.  Which reminds me, I need some new kicks.

Why?

Mantan!!

How you sound?

Manray, I'm very sorry about ya boy Cheeba and Sloan.  Believe me, it gave me no joy pulling ya coattail about her, just lookin' out for a brother.  I feel you, all this stuff happenin' at once but you can't let if affect your work.  You gotta be professional.

No costume.  No blackface.

Because race has always been a sensitive issue in this country. Gary, I have no problem with people disagreeing with the show, it's when folks start trying to mess with my inherent right as an artist, that's when I get mad.  No one, in any way, shape or form should be censored.

Yes.  And I say yes because who is to judge?  Who is to stand before us and say this is righteous and this is not?  Who?  Who can play God?

Don't you people get it?  We're in the 21st Century.  Slavery was over four hundred years ago.  All that stuff people talked in the old days, it's over.  Folks always crying, white man this, white man that.  Let's all grow up.

Can I finish?  Thank you.  I had a great Aunt, we called her Sister. She went to her grave not believing man had walked on the Moon. 

I'm sorry I'm late.

I didn't find out about this very important staff meeting until...

So are you telling me everyone knew about this get-together except you?

C.P. Time is Colored People's Time. The stereotypical belief that Negroes are always late.  That Negroes have no sense of time - time except when it comes to music or dance.

I would prefer you not use that word in my presence.

I don't agree.  The Negro middle class does exist, and it's rich material for a dramatic series or sitcom.

...to white?  I still feel all of my scripts would make good shows.

I'm not sure if I can deliver what you want.

Yes!  Yes!  Yes!  I want a show that will make headlines, that will have millions and millions of households tuned in, glued to their televisions every week.  I want advertisers dying to buy on this show.  I'm gonna squeeze this show out of you if it kills you.

It's right and tight.  Good morning, let me introduce you to everybody. You know my assistant, Sloan.

I'm wid it.

It is called: MANTAN - THE NEW MILLENNIUM MINSTREL SHOW.

It will take a lot of courage and backbone on the part of the CNS to get this on the air.  In fact, I would understand fully if the subject matter is deemed too risque, too controversial.

I don't know if Whoopi is the way to go.

Mantan and Sleep 'n Eat.  Two real coons.  I know we're way out there but it's satire.

Exactly!

And Sleep 'n Eat is his comical sidekick?

This could be bigger than "Amos and Andy."

Let'em try.  I will kill to make this happen.

So what.  We would just give the NAACP a donation that would be the end of that.  No such thing as bad publicity.  So what.  Earlier you said singing and dancing.

Who are the other characters?

I don't know about that plantation angle.

We think so.

I want a hot, young white director. Maybe the kid, that pheenom who just did that hot new sexy Madonna video.

I just want you to meet him.  Keep an open mind.

Probably nuthin', but that's why it's such a sexy way to go. Sometimes an outsider has a fresh new outlook, a different unique perspective.  A black director, y'know what he's gonna do given the subject matter?  With this kid, the possibilities are endless.

If Spielburg can direct "The Color Purple" and "Amistad", our whiz kid can direct the Mantan pilot.

Derrick Coleman, he possessed all the talent in the world, coulda, shoulda, been a great ballplayer but alas D.C. didn't want it bad enough.  Delacroix, do you want it? Bad enough to kill for it?  Do you want it that much.

Dunwitty, don't leave.

Calm down, please.

We just punched it up a bit.  Made it funnier.

I seriously doubt that will ever happen.  Didn't I tell you I know your people better than you do. But if by some miracle you're correct, I'm gonna invite them inside my house and we'll have a sit down, discuss it like civil human beings.

They didn't even view a rough cut, just some scenes we quickly cut together.

The big mistake was my not believing in your genius earlier.  From the gitgo, from jump street.

Hello, Mommy, let me get rid of this other call.

I want to meet her one day, please tell her the great news.  I'm OUT like Vanilla Ice.

I want to speak with you.

It's me, Peerless.

It's been a long time.

Pleased to meet you.

Daddy, she's younger than me.

How did you end up here?

Because I had too much pride.  Too much integrity.  I wouldn't lick nobody's butt.  Some material I refused to do.

Another one of your conspiracies to hold ya career back?

Nuthin' I can't handle.

Where do you go from here?

Baby, you treat me so good. Peerless, you're a good son, I love you.  You never gave me no trouble.

Always keep 'em laughing.

Is that so?

Not that often.  He was excited to see you.

The drinking is for the pain.  It doesn't kill it, just dulls it.

Your father is proud of you.

He did the best way he knew how, Junebug is stubborn just like you.

Why didn't you tell me about this staff meeting?

What good are you if you don't tell me stuff like this?

It hit me like a ton of bricks.

The idea was out there in the universe.  Now what?

Do you know how you will use him?

The point being that him, the networks don't want Black people on television unless they are buffoons.

You getting cold feet?

Good.  I'm going to need your support.

And lose out on my money?  The only way I get paid is if I get fired. And that's what I intend to do.

Manray better not be bleeding to death.  I need him.  After we're done he can do whatever he wants to do, until then, he's ours.

This is Cheeba.

My problem is MANTAN THE NEW MILLENIUM MINSTREL SHOW.

It was the principle.  Dunwitty had to be enlightened.  I was making a point.  I take pride in my work. Plus, I already told you I wasn't gonna walk away from my money.

Like I said, all this for some twisted, distorted sense of principal.  Dunwitty, he just tolerates your Negroidal ass, he doesn't respect it.

Which one is your brother?

I'm gonna slit my wrists.  Cut my throat.  For the love of Joseph.

What do you want me to say?

C'mon.  You were only doing what family is supposed to be doing for family.  You gave your brother a shot.  That's all anybody can ask for, an opportunity, a chance, a shot.  He got his.

A small victory isn't that small when you've been use to losing.

A gift.

No matter what you think, you did come up with something unique. Open it.

I thought it was appropiate.

It's all good.  You got a hit show, you're gonna need a bank.  Plus, I love these old black collectibles.

I don't want to hear it.

You're the one that put us together. We're friends.

He's just playing big brother.

Please don't go there.

I can't lie to him.  If he asks me something, I tell him what I think.

That's why it will be so much fun.

The first and only time.  A big mistake.  I'm gonna have to ask you not to see Mantan anymore.

DeLa, kiss my big black ass.

I didn't think this was in your studies at NYU.

I perfectly understand where you're coming from.  As a minority I can relate to your struggle also.  But I think you should give us all a chance.  We want this pilot to be successful just as much as you. Please don't be so quick to judge us based only on our whiteness.

David, I appreciate your comments. Anybody got an ideas?  Everybody just talk out loud.

Pressure?  DeLa, you don't know what the hell real pressure is. SHEEETT!!!  This is lightstuff. Now when you scramblin' out on the street in da January winter and the hawk is talkin' to you with NO money and NO prospects of money anytime soon, now that there is some pressure.

Now I'm privileged?!  Why?  Because I didn't grow up on food stamps and welfare?  Because I didn't call home a cardboard box?  No, I never ever went to bed hungry and I'm proud of it, too.  Whoever told you that living in poverty earns you somekind of badge of honor flat out lied to you.

Naw.  I'll take the zero.

I feel fine.

Sloan, will you take your boss out of here so I can get ready.

You sound like the media.

No.

Yo, DeLa, they tried to lynch my black ass up in dat piece.

Yeah.

Sloan is the hardest working person I've ever met.

I don't believe it.

My name is Manray, goddamnit.

It looks delicious.

C'mon, Mommy, don't start with that I'm an ungrateful son stuff.

Can't beat it with a hammer.  Well, since you asked, it looks like I may have a new show, a pilot being shot.

If at first it's not what you want, just work that much harder, Peerless.

Son, Peerless is your name.  Now you might be one of these Hollywood types, change your name and all that but Peerless Dothan is on your birth certificate.

I guess he's still on the road. What kind of show is this?  Are they some Negroes in it without being buffoons?

Peerless, I didn't raise a buffoon. We have enough of those on television already.

I will.  And good luck with your show.  I hope it's a huge success. You've worked very hard.  You deserve it.

He said that?

Where is he?

I don't even know why you're still concerned over him.  Daddy's not with you.

It's gonna be hard for me to get away with the show taking off.

You going to attack me too.  The show is a hit.  Aren't you happy for me?

Not at all?

Soon.

I just turned twenty.

Helsinki, which is the capital of Finland.

You know, Finlandia vodka?  Yes?

What's a Negro.

Well before there was BLACK or AFRICAN AMERICAN, there were NEGROES.  I'M A NEGRO.

Then will you teach me what I need to know.  Maybe we learn from each other, if that's possible, no?

Thank you very much.  I always try my best.

First, I would like to say I love the show.  It's very courageous. My parents marched in Selma, Alabama with Dr. King.

The best defense is offense.

We all stick to this, it's smooth sailing.

Thank you.  And always smile.

I wish I had your natural talent. God only makes that visit once in a while.

A little.  I just graduated from NYU film school.  Cinema studies.

You're welcome.  You shouldn't give up on performing.

Tavis, thank you for having me.

I'm more comfortable around my people.

Money makes the world go round.  It ain't no joke being poor.  I know whatI'mtalkin''bout. Y'knowwhatI'msayin'?  I've lived on the street.  I've been homeless. I've learned how to play the game, work the game, be in the game.

I don't know what a retort is, but it's simple.  Mantan - The New Millennium Minstrel Show is UNIVERSAL.  It's not just for Negroes in Compton or 125th in Harlem.  This is America.  Our ancestors helped build this country, we got a right, just like everybody else.  I'm not gonna box myself in. This show makes people think, and they're laughing at the same time.

And this is my very best friend Mantan.

Tell 'em what you mean Mistuh Mantan.

Give or cousins some of dem educated feets.

You tellin' the truth.

Oh her.

Sleep 'N Eat, one of dem slinky, sexy, little foxy...

I thought you got rid of...

...dat's too much money.  I can't 'ford it.  I needs me a dress that cost no mo' than...

...I heard different, thought that was...

So when are you comin' to pick us up?

...too early...

...too late, maybe around...

That's what I like about you and me. We git along...

...like grits and butter...

You slept too near where you got in?

You expect the unexpected in circumstances of that peculiarity.

Mantan, it is possible that my hyphenated sentences are entirely too complex for all the intellect contained in that diminutive coconut?

Ain't Jemima on the pancake box?

How be dat?

Well, I'll be an Alabama porch monkey's uncle.

Mantan, dat sho' is a whopper.

A song a comin' I feel.

Well, homeboy, looks like he's at a funeral.

What do you want to know?

I'm an asthmatic.  Been one all my life.  Can't go anywhere without an inhaler.

Are you trying to rap to me?

Sloan, I got it like 'dat.

Just a little something' somethin'.

No, before my time.

Never read a book in my whole life.

Maybe I need to do a lot of things.

I just don't want you and Cheeba to get hurt.

Y'know what?

You look beautiful like that.

Worked my black ass off, first as an intern, then worked my way up to this position.

And what?

Say what, Manray?

We did it one time, only once.  It had nothing to do with the job, it was stupid.  Everything I've got I've earned.

Why don't you answer?

You can go now.

Good morning.

Not at all, sir.  I have a pair of good pistols that have already done execution, and are ready to do it again.

If you're insulted, and not satisfied, remember there's two of us, Best.

Ten, sir, and make them short ones, do you hear, Captain Grogan?

I'll tell you what it is, Mr. Dugan. I have had enough of Miss Dugan here and your Irish ways.  I ain't used to 'em, sir.

What is your uncle's name?

Oh, yes, of course, Ambassador O'Grady...

This may be a very good inn for Germany, but it would not pass in old Ireland.  Corbach is only a league off, let us push on for Corbach.

The place seems more a farm than an inn-yard.

It was my joke.  I was tired, and did not care to go farther.  There's not prettier woman here than that. If she won't suit your fancy, my friend, then you must wait awhile.

I have acted as I think fit.

How do you do, sir?

Your loyalty to me and your service to the regiment has pleased me very well -- and now there is another occasion on which you may make yourself useful to us; if you succeed, depend on it, your reward will be your discharge from the army, and a bounty of 100 guineas.

There is lately come to Berlin a gentleman in the service of the Empress Queen, who calls himself the Chevalier de Belle Fast, and wears the red riband and star of the pope's order of the Spur.  He is made for good society, polished, obliging, a libertine, without prejudices, fond of women, of good food, of high play, prudent and discreet.

Only a very little, as soldiers do.

I am not sure.  The Prince told him quite clearly that if he wished to have the money, he would have to fight for it.

Not yet, but I believe he intends to.

And his baggage?

Faith, I think you are a lad that's likely to keep your word.

And so I am.

Mark this, come what will of it, I swear I will fight the man who pretends to the hand of Dorothy Dugan.  I'll follow him if it's into the church, and meet him there. I'll have his blood, or he shall have mine.  Will you take my message to him, and arrange the meeting?

The meeting is arranged.  Captain Best is waiting for you now.

It was with this sword that my late father, Harry James, God rest his soul, met Sir Huddelstone Fuddelstone, the Hampshire baronet, and was fatally run through the neck.  He was quite in the wrong, having insulted Lady Fuddelstone, when in liquor, at the Brentford Assembly.  But, like a gentleman, he scorned to apologize.

I am Harry James' son, and will act as becomes my name and quality.

Oh, it's with pistols we fight.  You are no match for Best with the sword.

But swords are today impossible; Captain Best is -- is lame.  He knocked his knee against the swinging park gate last night, as he was riding home, and can scarce move it now.

It must have been some other gate.

A man of honor dies, but never apologizes.  I'll see the captain hanged before I apologize.

I had news of you in Dublin.  Faith, you've begun early, like your father's son, but I think you could not do better than as you have done. But why did you not write home to your poor mother?  She has sent half-a-dozen letters to you in Dublin.

We must write to her today, and you can tell her that you are safe and married to "Brown Bess."

Is Miss Dugan well?

Good heavens!  Whatever?  Has she died of grief?

I am only sorry that I was unable to prevent the villain from carrying off all her ladyship's money and pearls.

Which O'Higgins do you know?  For I have never heard your name mentioned in my family.

Sirrah!  Sirrah, I am as good a gentleman as any in Ireland!

Repeat the words again, and I run you through the body.

I deny your Grace's accusations, and beg you to say how you have been cheated?

Your Grace, if I am so tame as to take this, then I must give up an honorable and lucrative occupation.

I will let down the steps for your honor.

You are going to drive to the frontier.

I have orders to gag your honor if you cry out, and to give you this purse containing ten thousand frederics if you do not.

As you please.

The gentleman has nothing contraband.

Yes, sir.  Here is my letter.

Yes, sir.

Herr Seebach was a very kind employer.

No one, sir.  Before that I served in the army but had to leave due to weakness of the loins.

I'd give five years of my life to see the old country again, the greenfields, and the river, and the old round tower, and the burying place.

I can play as soldiers do, but have no great skill.

Have no fear.  It will come out well for me.

I have faced that problem before.

Make your mind easy, you shall not be left behind, I warrant you.  Do take a last look at your barracks, make your mind easy, say a farewell to your friends in Berlin.  The dear souls, how they will weep when they hear you are out of the country, and, out of it, you shall go.

Then ordering fresh horses, the Chevalier set off on his journey for that capital.  I need not tell you that I was the Chevalier.

Sir, we have but eighty thousand florins in bank, or two hundred thousand at three months; if your highness' bags do not contain more than eight thousand, we will meet you.

To risk one's life against such people is an imposition.

Certain?

Certainly, monseigneur, does not Your Excellency consider her worthy of love?

Very well!  Now that I know it, I will no longer love her.

On the instant.  Everyone must yield to such a nobleman as you.

That is a trifle strong.

Have you had one?

But, for a time... a passing fancy?

Have you not a man whom you value?

What!  You have not met a man worthy of your attention?

It is nonetheless a misfortune, and you will know it when you love.

That is true, but it seems to me impossible that you should be unhappy in love.

I agree; but God put us on earth to take that risk.

I believe you, and I see I must hasten to leave, for otherwise I shall become the unhappiest of men.

By loving you, with no hope of possessing you.

It is my only object.

To love you until death.  To subscribe to all your commands.

Deceiving someone without knowing it is something new for me.  If I do not know it, I am innocent.

With a woman who is completely charming, be she a princess or a woman of the lowest condition, and who, regardless of her rank, will show me some kindness, tonight.

Yes -- but I am afraid of being deceived.

I ask only a payment on account today -- after that, you will find me undemanding, obedient and discreet.

Always, my dear one, never any further.  Love is a child to be pacified with trifles.  A full diet can only kill it.

Our abstinence makes our love immortal.  If I loved you a quarter of an hour ago, now I should love you even more.  But I should love you less if you exhausted my joy by satisfying all my desires.

My husband has convinced me of the contrary.

O, my dearest love.  Enough!  I beg you.  Stop believing in your experience.  You have never known love.  My very soul is leaving me! Catch it on your lips, and give me yours!

Let me give a thousand kisses to that heavenly mouth which has told me that I am happy.

We then spent an hour in the most eloquent silence except that, from time to time, her ladyship cried out:  "Oh, my God.  Is it true -- I am not dreaming?"

Roderick, you know well enough that I have never loved but you!  Was I ever so wretched that a kind word from you did not make me happy? Ever so angry, but the least offer of good-will on your part did not bring me to your side?  Did I not give a sufficient proof of my affection for you in bestowing one of the finest fortunes of England upon you?  Have I repined or rebuked you for the way you have wasted it? No, I loved you too much and too fondly; I have always loved you. From the first moment I saw you, I saw your bad qualities, and trembled at your violence; but I could not help loving you.  I married you, though I knew I was sealing my own fate in doing so, and in spite of reason and duty.  What sacrifice do you want from me?  I am ready to make any, so you will but love me, or, if not, that at least, you will gently us me.

Old fool!

Agreed.

Then you must get it.

With pleasure at finding the ribbon.

I had not been in the room five minutes before I was engaged for every single set.

I don't care a fig for Captain Best; he dances prettily to be sure, and is a pleasant rattle of a man.  He looks well in his regimentals, too; and if he chose to ask me to dance, how could I refuse him?

Oh!  I can dance with you any day, and to dance with your own cousin at a ball as if you could find no other partner.  Besides, Roderick, Captain Best's a man, and you are only a boy, and you haven't a guinea in the world.

But Captain Best is already known as a valiant soldier, and is famous as a man of fashion in London.  It is mighty well of you to fight farmers' boys, but to fight an Englishman is a very different matter.

As much as possible.

Yes, for I wish to entertain splendidly.

It is entirely up to you.  I want the best.

All right, five hundred guineas.

Well, sir, this nobleman is one of the gentlemen of His Majesty's closet, and one with whom our revered monarch is on terms of considerable intimacy.  I should say you would be wise to fix upon this nobleman your chief reliance for the advancement of your claim to the Viscounty which you propose to get.

Yes!

Yes, Minister, I am interested in any work in which I can be of service to Captain Galgenstein.

In so far as I can tell these things -- no.  I believe the Chevalier won the money fairly.

The Prince left him only that choice.

Oh, I am grateful to you, sir.  I am the wife of Captain O'Reilly hastening to join him at Dublin.  My chair was stopped by a highwayman; this great oaf of a servant-man fell down on his knees, armed as he was, and though there were thirty people in the next field, working, when the ruffian attacked, not one of them would help but, on the contrary, wished him "good luck."

I am riding to Dublin myself, and if your ladyship will allow me the honor of riding with you, I shall do my best to protect you from further mishap.

O'Higgins... Mohawk O'Higgins.

That's very kind of you, Mr. O'Higgins.

You must be very cautious with regard to the company you should meet in Dublin, where rogues and adventurers of all countries abound. I hope you will do me the honor of accepting lodgings in my own house, where Captain O'Reilly will welcome with delight, my gallant young preserver.

Mr. Newcombe, I have made some difficult loans during the past few years, at very onerous terms, but 18% a year interest seems very stiff indeed.

I am prepared to accept the terms, Mr. Newcombe.

Provided that they can be assured of her ladyship's freewill?  Are you serious?

Yes, of course.

Now, just have a little patience, my boy.  Your birthday isn't until next week.

Well, we'll just have to wait and see, won't we?

Good night, my little darling.

Yes, papa.

Is he all right, papa?

Brooksy was better than you, papa, he used not to swear so, and he taught me many good things while you were away.

Hang it, Mr. Roderick James, you have no more manners than a barber, and I think my black footman has been better educated than you; but you are a young fellow of originality and pluck, and I like you, sir.  because you seem determined to go to the devil by a way of your own.

The milkmaid's daughter?

Good evening, Mr. James, have you done with my lady?

Come, come, sir.  I am a man who would rather be known as a cuckold than a fool.

Faith, sir, if I want to learn good principles, it's surely better I should apply for them to your lady, and your chaplin than to you?

Is it not a pleasure, gentlemen, for me, as I am drawing near the goal, to find my home such a happy one; my wife so fond of me, that she is even now thinking of appointing a successor?  Isn't it a comfort to see her; like a prudent housewife, getting everything ready for her husband's departure?

Not so soon, my dear, as you may fancy perhaps.  Why, man, I have been given over many times these four years, and there was always a candidate or two waiting to apply for the situation.  Who knows how long I may keep you waiting.

I am sorry for you Mr. James.  I'm grieved to keep you or any gentleman waiting.  Had you not better to arrange with my doctor or get the cook to flavor my omelette with arsenic?  What are the odds, gentlemen, that I don't live to see Mr. James hang yet?

Do you expect me to believe that your lover brought you here tonight?

And he doesn't care about me?

If his love were like mine, he would not permit you to come here.

Will he wish to know the details of this night?

Tender Hegenheim.

It's ten thirty in the morning.

You know the law -- no liquor before noon. Could lose my license.

Yeah, and I could've used the sleep. I'm supposed to meet people here tonight, try and get some work going.

Who?

I'm -- I'm sorry...

I thought I was gonna have an attack. Go into a fit and bite off my own tongue in the middle of the bayou. Childs could tell I wasn't right.

Fine.

It was the grenade you fucking idiot. Look at him!

Maybe he'll be there. Either way, we have to go.

Maybe he's dead too. Maybe you killed them both, Mueller --

None of that matters now. We got two dead bodies and a story that explains them. You're either with us, or against us -- which is it?

Can anybody hear me!

We found him like this --

We found him like this! Kendall was with me the whole -- Listen to me!

Before or after the explosion?  Mueller --

HEY!

Shut up, Mueller.

We don't know. West is dead.

Shut up.  West's dead.

I asked for a policeman.

It's... too slow.

I just don't like it.

Okay.

Tell me about them.

Yeah. And that's all I'm saying.

This is one of those interrogation tricks, isn't it? You don't give me a cigarette till I tell you more.

That son of a bitch.

He's lying.

I'm serious --

Did Kendall tell you about the PX?

I didn't shoot West --

Yeah --

They would have killed us both. You want me to write a confession, I'll write a confession.

But not Pike's.

Mr. Hardy, I joined the army for college money. I didn't ask for any of this -- I tried to do the right thing out there and people got killed. You say finding those bodies'll help me, then go find them. I don't want to die.

You wanna bet?

Oh, you don't? What else do you have on me? You haven't found any bodies yet, have you?

Jesus!

Do what?

And the bodies?

Washout rejects, guys he said were "dumbfucks too stupid to know they dead"...

Epilepsy.

No, did he tell you about it? About the business Childs ran?

Pills, shots, you name it, Basic's a lot easier when you don't feel pain --

The creek bed --

One went off, yeah, but it didn't touch him -- I thought you knew this --

Mueller was alone in the cabin?

Would you have believed me?

Don't know on a map. West told us it was there, we just found it. Maybe the hurricane took it away.

Can't do that now, though, can you?

We can prove that you're not Ray Dunbar. Impersonating a fellow Cadet is a court-martial in and of itself --

How do you know that?

Sir, Dunbar, sir!

Sir, yes, sir!

Your weapons, Sergeant.

Oh, bullshit, he's a fucking convict. You know how much he hated West --

I...

West's. Any kindling for afire?

I mean I killed him.  Isn't that what we all wanted?

Wandering through a hurricane trying to find this place. It's gettin' bad out there --  Where's West?

We just want to check your pack --

Do I?

You hated West more than any of us.

You're the only one missing a grenade.

If not you, then who?

That's exactly what he says about you.

Enough to go to prison? Childs' PX scam, Mueller was in on it --

Look in my pack.

Just look. Little pocket.

You're lying --

Becoming a morphine addict during Basic ain't exactly something you want to broadcast. Only Mueller and Childs know.

You saw West, right? How was he killed?

That's close range. You go full auto on a guy from close range, you're gonna be swimming in blood. Look at my uniform. Nothing.

What don't you know?

No... no, we can just wait till we get back and then tell the M.P.'s --

But not the only victim, right?

Senator Daddy must be thrilled.

I think you just blew "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" out of the fucking water.

But you didn't.

Right in front of us. Mueller went after him but we held him back.

I honestly don't know. Maybe to have someone to cover for him. And I wish I could, but there's no doubt in my mind he killed those men.

Stop.

How many murders did you cover up? One? Five? Maybe an even ten.

My heart weeps.

There's that word again.  As I told you, I wasn't in the room when everyone started shooting.

No. I said Dunbar.

Well?

I was just thinking of what's going to happen to your careers when my father gets through with you.

I didn't do anything --

Because of what I saw.  Who really killed West.

Because I was standing next to him.

I didn't --

I don't know --

Been better.  I read about what's been happening with you... I should have called --

And here you are going out of house. How's that make you feel, Jules?

And the problem is you only got three.

I'm assuming that's what made him the dead one?

The guy in interrogation said he'd only talk to a cop.

I'm not gonna let that happen.

He can wait. Kendall's out of surgery.

Who killed Pike?

There was a hurricane, Bill, the wind probably moved it.

Okay, then let's widen the search to include the endzone in Giants Stadium and the trunk of my car --

From Dunbar? I hate to break this to you, but I don't think he's gonna be all that psyched to put himself in for the death penalty.

Nevertheless what'? Kendall will testify and that'll be enough.

JAG gets here in three hours. Try for the confession.

Home, I'm done.

What the hell are you talking about --

Was dead right. You think Dunbar's on the level?

Does Osborne agree?

That's horseshit and you know it.

I wouldn't know where to start.  I guess it was about one man framing another. He thought if the other guy got blamed, people would over look his own wrong doings.

Don't be. I'm not cut out to deal with the West's of the world.

I thought you said that wasn't a compliment.

What are you talking about?

You're drunk --

Or what? You've gone round the bend --

That's preposterous --

I wanted to see if he was okay --

I'm not even going to dignify that --

You want to get into a finger pointing contest about character? The army kicked you out for drugs, the cops fired you for taking bribes from a mobster, and you think you can stand there and lecture me on codes of conduct? There's only one criminal standing in this room and it's you.

You're crazy --

For the last time, I have no idea what you're talking about --

Fantastic. You want to tell me what's going on?

You knew Sergeant West?

Sergeant West's served for twenty- three years. He's the public face of the modern Army.

You and the Colonel go back.

You're the Tom Hardy I've been reading about in the papers, right? New Orleans PD fired you for taking bribes from Guissepe Torres.

Wording and your friendship with the Colonel aside, I'm not comfortable having you involved in this.

Hurricane knocked out our Mainframe, so all we have are their dogtags. Cadets Raymond Dunbar and Levi Kendall --

Yes.

Why?

See, Ray, this is what we call "good cop, bad cop". She shouts, I stand up for you, you're grateful, a bond of trust is established.

I believe somebody owes me ten dollars --

Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't know the object of the interrogation is to make you look good -- Everyone knows good cop, bad cop -- by admitting it I appeared trustworthy.

You're right. We should sit in silence.

Best time for banal chit-chat.

Microrecorder for Kendall -- didn't have time to wire his room. Now tell me why you joined the army or I'll jab this pen through your neck.

I lost a bet.

I plan to grow on you.

What point?

Being back here. Gives me the willies.

Got it.

Have no fear, Osborne, we have not yet begun to fight.

I lied. Wait for it...

I don't think that has anything to do with --

Everyone's capable of murder, Osborne.

Well, I'm sure if he'd known this was all going to happen he'd have tried harder to witness it for you --

I don't know.

You knew what he was capable of and you just stood by. It was just a matter of time till somebody fragged his ass, and you know what? He deserved it. There's your confession.

Watch me.

You did more than try. You cracked Dunbar in less than three minutes, as an investigator you're phenomenal --

Because it's my job. Because people are dead. Because of the whole honor and duty thing, make a difference in the world, crap like that.  We can do this, Hardy.

What?

What happened next?

And they're smart about it. They know when you commit a crime you know is going to be investigated, you need a fall guy and for that to work, you have to have a witness.

And if they're asked, that's what they'll tell the, world.

And all hell breaks loose. A lot of Good guys shoot a lot of bad guys and whiz, bang, zoom, happy ending.

That bugs you too?

Let's go talk to Bill...

They got their stories straight.

What Kendall said -- "the type of guys you don't feel comfortable going to sleep around." That's what Dunbar said about Childs to the letter.

Positive. Hardy, they planned this.

Good idea.

See, I just take your gun to the morgue and fire it into one of their skulls; then I call every newspaper in the country with the story about how Senator Kendall's gay son went nuts on a training mission --

You couldn't have known --

You wanted to get the truth.

You mean the falsely accused?

Yeah.

Now I go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened.

Nah.

It dawned on me one day that we were supposed to be a nation founded on the principle of questioning authority... and all I did here was follow orders. It didn't add up. Plus, I got kicked out.

That's gonna stay my secret.

Maybe... Maybe we were nowhere near. Sometimes mysteries stay mysteries.  I haven't by any chance grown on you, have I?

Good, just making sure.

Get in.

Right back where we started.

Isn't this how your story goes?

Hardy, for Chrissakes --

No death certificates. No crime.

Seven.

Seven guys. What was it you said? You were "just starting to believe I wasn't the guy people said".

This is the perfect time. You know what makes a good detective? The number of confessions they get. You're a good detective, Osborne. So now you get mine.

Tough.

There are degrees of truth, officer. Always degrees.

Really.

Nobody saw. But I don't think so.

Yeah. I can wait till you're off the base and do it myself.

Leaving without saying goodbye. What are you gonna do?

Want company?

I should probably write that down.

In case you need me to testify about the shooting. They'll clear you.

Yeah. But he was a lot of other things, too. Thanks.

Mueller. He's as bad as West and we both know it. Now I can't do it, cause I'm tied up, but we get the others to go along --

Someone else can do the deed, it doesn't have to be you. Maybe Nunez too, he's got a tendency to follow Mueller, but the rest of us can come out ahead -- the guys who took out their Sergeant's killers! We'll move the bodies out to the creek and say we came over the hill right as they fragged West, all we gotta do is tell the story right.

Although that won't matter much when coupled with the murder charge --

The faggot speaks.

You ever been in a hurricane, Mueller?

Oh, yeah, "Excuse me, Sergeant, sir, we don't feel like going out -- we don't want to get rained on." He'll kick our asses from here to Cleveland.

Yeah and he doesn't know when --

Oh, you remember now --

So you took off your shirt?

"You're gonna die tonight, faggot". Clear as day.

He whispered it in my ear.

Because he'd shot Mueller.

We've been making progress, I see.

Fifty minutes.

You can't threaten me --

What?

It will and you know why? Because you're not a person anymore, you're a cadet in the United States Army; you have no identity, no Miranda warning, and no rights. So I'm gonna throw you to the wolves, and unlike you, I'm gonna get away with it, because you're pissing me off!

Wait --

Wrong answer --

Childs.

I scared Dunbar into silence. He's been trying to cover for me the whole time. We got here, you came to see me... I didn't know if I could trust him with that kind of secret --

He came after us. And I told Dunbar he had to kill him...

Toughens us up, Pike. You don't like it, quit.

What the fuck happened to you? One minute you're next to me and the next you're gone and the sky lights up like fucking Christmas --

Blame the nigger, then, huh? Someone turns up dead, you just look for the darkest face in the crowd --

Shut the fuck up.  He was gonna cut him loose.

Where's your shirt, Mueller?

Still got mine on, not a speck of blood on it. Not a bad trick for a murderer -- you said you burned yours?

We're not going anywhere.

The fuck are you talking about --

Bullshit --

Shut up!

-- failure to comply with this arrest is a court martialable offense in and of itself --

No, no that was Cadet Dunbar --

He asked to see a policeman, we're getting him a policeman.

He's former Army and the best I've ever seen in a room. Besides, he knows the territory, we did Basic together here.  You've had three hours with Dunbar and haven't gotten a peep, we need to take a different tack.

I called the JAG Corps, the two cadets we retrieved are to be flown to D.C. on a transport leaving here at 1700 --

No --

It's too neat.

We know.

Gets on his plane in ten minutes, which means you two are done. You'll understand if I don't walk you out.

The army kicked you out for drugs...

Sir, yes, sir!

Sir, yes, sir!

Sir, yes, sir!

It was on that night Karl met his destiny. And I met mine. Almost.

That's great.

I just saw the woman I'm going to marry, I know it. But then I lost her.

Yes!

Who is she? Where does she live?

Sure I do. You were hot shit back in Hickville, but here in the real world, you got squat. You don't have a plan. You don't have a job. You don't have anything but the clothes on your back.

Kid, you were a big fish in a small pond. This here is the ocean, and you're drowning. Take my advice and go back to Puddleville. You'll be happy there.

A few rabbits, but I think one of them was already dead.

There's only one I want.

Thank you.

Edward Bloom.

Yes.

The town of Spectre. Best kept secret in Alabama. Says here you're from Ashton, right? Last person we had from Ashton was Norther Winslow.

It truly is.

Why?

No one's ever left.

I don't expect to.

Fine, I will.

Fine, I'm doing it.

I brought it.

Don.

Absolutely. Be good for you to talk to him.

My father and I have an advantage. We never talk.

Thirty years. Maybe more.

Five-eleven. One-eighty. Regulated hypertension.  How would his son describe him?

A thousand times. He caught an uncatchable fish.

No.

What did she look like?

Was she nekkid?

It's not a woman, it's a fish. No one ever catches her.

Eighteen.

I suspect it will hurt a lot.

I promise. Someday. When I'm really supposed to.

Apparently I've overlooked this one piece of it, and I'd like to remedy that. You see, in order for the town to be preserved, the trust must own it in its entirety.

I'll offer you more than it's worth. And you know you won't have to move. Nothing will change except the name on the deed, you have my word.

I'm not convinced you should be happy.

I see. I thank you for your time.

Go.

I know.

Lucky girl.

You're lucky to get four words out of them in English. But if you were to walk through the jungle, you'd hear them speaking the most elaborate French. Those parrots talk about everything: politics, movies, fashion -- everything but religion.

That's terrible.

No, I understand.

Stop.

Can I take your picture?

Please?

I never knew.

Well, we were all set to, but there was a complication.

Truth is, I've been thirsty my whole life. Never really known why.

You were talking about your wedding.

I like your stories.

I can.

Mine's Edward. And truthfully, I do want you to leave, Karl. But I want to leave with you.  You think this town is too small for you, well, it's too small for a man of my ambition. I can't see staying here a day longer.

I love every square inch of it. But I can feel the edges closing in on me. A man's life can only grow to a certain size in a place like this.  So what do you say? Join me?

Okay.

That poet, Norther Winslow did. He was going to Paris, France. He must have liked it, because no one ever heard from him again.  Tell you what. You take the other way and I'll cut through here. Meet you on the far side.

Just to be sure, you can take my pack.

Make him stop.

Friend of yours? Did you help him out of a bind?

No Dad, they don't. I do not like the story. Not anymore, not after a thousand times. I know all the punchlines, Dad. I can tell them as well as you can.  For one night, one night in your entire life, the universe does not revolve around Edward Bloom. It revolves around me and my wife. How can you not understand that?

Am I?

You think I'm up for it?

Really.

No, she was old and probably senile. Maybe schizophrenic.

Okay.

What did he say?

There's a lot you don't know about me.

You mean, while I'm here.

I will.

I used to do it when you were gone, remember? I used to do it a lot.

I said this isn't how I go. The last part is much more unusual. Trust me on that.

It's rude to talk about religion. You never know who you're going to offend.

Oh, so you know.

Yes.

I think someone hasn't.

Dad?

Can we talk?

Do I? I saw an iceberg once. They were hauling it down to Texas for drinking water, only they didn't count on an elephant being frozen inside. The woolly kind. A mammoth.

What?

Then you shouldn't have started with a question. Because people want to answer questions. You should have started with, "The thing about icebergs is..."

What, you're seeing down to my nose? My chin?

I've told you a thousand facts. That's all I do, Will. I tell stories.

You think I'm fake.

It would kill you, huh?

Yourself. Good, bad, everything. Just show me who you are for once.

The river?

How what happens?

Somehow, you're better. Different. You're getting ready to go. And I say...

You say...

Story of my life.

Don't need to apologize to me. I mean, I'm the luckiest person you're going to find today...

But you're wrong. I do know you, at least by reputation. Edward Bloom from Ashton. See, I'm actually engaged to a boy from Ashton. Don Price. He was a few years older than you.

They're your favorite flower.

I called everywhere in five states and explained this was the only way I could get my wife to marry me.

I see. We need to get you one of those plant misters. We can spray you like a fern.

Really.

I want you to know, when you left Spectre it opened my eyes. There was a whole life out there that I was not living. So I travelled. I saw France, and Africa, half of South America. Every day a new adventure, that's my motto.

I'm robbing this place.

'Fraid so.

I am. And you're Will. I've seen your picture, that's how I recognize you. I almost said something at the store, but it would have been awkward.  Like this.

This was on his sales route, so he was through here all the time. Everyone in town knew him.

Wow. Wow, you just said it. I was expecting to dance around this for another half hour.

My father talked about a lot of things he never did, and I'm sure he did a lot of things he never talked about. I'm just trying to reconcile the two.

No, it's logical if you think like your father. See, to him, there's only two women: your mother and everyone else.

Well, therapy. And one day I realized I was in love with a man who could never love me back. I was living in a fairy tale.

Yes.

We'll have to pick up a copy.

I'll help you.

I need to lie down for a bit.

I know. It was the same when I was carrying Will. Like clockwork.

I do.

It's more than they thought. They're going to stop chemo.

Probably tonight.

That's because most of it never happened.

Mmm, what?

Everyone loves my father. He's a very likeable guy.

I am always on your side. And I think you should talk to him.

Your father had a stroke. He's upstairs with your mom and Dr. Bennett.

We swam. The Atlantic, it's not that big really.

We rented a car.

He's up with your father.

He's impossible. He won't eat. And because he won't eat, he gets weaker. And because he's weaker, he doesn't want to eat.

You don't talk about those things. Not yet.

Really! That's wonderful.

Of course.

Yes.

Yes, Will, I do. And don't presume things you don't know.

Yes. But that's a different...

Yes, you both think William Bloom is a very smart man.  The problem is, you only see me as your mother, and not as someone's wife. And I've been his wife longer than I've been your mother. You can't discount that.

Mom, do you know who that is? Blonde hair.

No. But it's weird. She seemed to recognize me.

Not everything your father says is a complete fabrication.

He just fell asleep. Josephine's with him.

Yes?

I suppose your grandmother's house when she passed on. But we sold that right away. Your cousin Shirley bought it.

Heavens no. We had a hard enough time keeping the mortgage on this place.

I'll stay. Why don't you go home with Josephine and I'll stay tonight.

Yes. Thank you.

Fifty thousand. Almost exactly.

What for?

The sets were excellent. Everything was big, you know, all the rubbish, coke cans, sweet wrappers, dustbins, so when you were watching it you felt cat size. It was really clever.

There's over eighty thousand here.

What do you mean?

Do you want to stop?

We'll stop then.

It's nothing. I burnt myself.

It is. I did it cooking.

Yeah.

Thank you.

Name it.

What are you doing here?

Leave him!

No I haven't.

Right.

I thought you could give us the tour this morning. Sort of be our Indian Guide.

What are you doing here?

I'm asking what you're here for.

He says he feels safe here.

Oh.  We are Russian.

And what? You mean from the beginning? Jesus. Can I uh okay, as we say in Russia can I cut a long story short. Okay. Nadia is my little cousin. Except she's not. But we say cousin. This is for you.

Toast first then we talk seriously, I can see you are serious about us.

We better watch him. He's crazy.

I am actor, he is actor, although he is an actor stroke musician. I just noodle along, I'm not so good. He makes me look like a retard -- He smokes me. I don't mean he smokes me.

Right. So I can say he smokes me. So.

So I come to England with other actors to make shows, I meet this freak from Novgorod I tell him of you and Chicken and the birthday here we are.

I asked her if you were happy to see us. I find it hard to tell with you.

Plans are for the architects, politicians and so forth.

You're asking for my documents?

Uh. Do you like England?

What?

"I saw you waiting there, by the gate."

"I have these uh..." She explains to you... "When I was a little girl my father had these beautiful old glasses." Like... I don't know the word. Like for watching uh... for watching the birds.

Oh nothing.

No. It is too judgmental.

He says why did you send to Russia for a wife.

No. It's not that.

I suppose it's... I mean define your terms.

Fine. I thought you were leaving today.

You can stay tonight.

John.

He says you are very sad ridiculous man. I don't agree of course. And that you must pay someone to have sex like a prostitute. Nadia is a prostitute. I'm sorry.

He wants money.

I'll give him money. Tell him to put the...

He is sure you can do this. Of course you can not.

I'm so sorry.

Yes.

Yes.

Yes.

Yes.

Yes.

Yes.

Yes.

Yes.

Yes.

Sorry?

Happy bath day.

Syevodnya

Yes I know.

What's wrong?

Of course. They go. Yes. Yes.

You don't understand anything.

It's makes it easier. Okay.

It makes it faster. If I don't speak to the men, they fall faster. It's pretty obvious why.

I'm going to drink my coffee. Then, we're going to the police station. Where there will be lawyers, loss of job, house, humiliation, gutter press, and probably prison.

Even so I always felt the decision to burst in and rob it very much remained with me.

Well as it turns out I did.

I know you just want to punish me --

You can't hurt me more than I'm hurt already.

What?

What? No you're not..

No you're not. How... Nice one. How dumb do you think I am ?

Have you got your passport?

Shut up. Have you got your passport?

I don't have any money.

I said I don't have any.

I don't want to talk about him.

But, you know, so what?

He will come back.

Why not?

Okay we won't talk about it.

So. What's it like having to fuck men you hate?

Okay. Let's... Okay. Okay. You have had sex with people you don't like haven't you? For money. To make money.

And. It's wrong.

And that would be Morals. That would be one's own moral sense of decency.

So. What then? You just detach sex from everything..

Listen. I didn't go rooting around in your private stuff.

Sometimes.

Sometimes neither.

There's nothing wrong in liking sex, John.

Why?

So now you hate all women?

You...

You didn't mind too much.

So what did you want? I think we understand each other, no?

You don't understand you either.

Please, there's no... Oh.

Then okay.  So how old were you when you met him?

Thank Christ for that.

I'm pretty naive? Look at you. You have to do all this, and what have you got to show for it? Nothing.

No.

Not really. Maybe a little.

It's none of your business. She didn't have small eyes.

She's dead.

I don't know why I said that. She's not dead at all.

I don't know why I said it. I'm sorry.

Laugh it up.

I'm trying to quit.

I smoke more these days. I smoke more when I'm unhappy.

Maybe I want to die. Don't you want me to die?

Except for Small Eyes.

What was her name?

It's alright.

No. I think I better just go.

Whatever.

Please. Why not?

Goodbye.

I'm quitting. This will be my last one. So. Goodbye.

You didn't deserve me John Buckingham.

It's not mine either.

I'm not asking you to marry me.

It's more like a date.

Tell me about it.

Maybe you will find out.

Right.

Sophia. Hello Sophia. Mine's still John.

I'm sorry Sir. I believe the flight is closed.

Thanks.

Cash.

Just wanted to see.

Yeah, I know.

Yes, ma'am.

Oh! Gave me a start.

You hurt it?

Been on the crop. May need to get some extra hands if I don't want to work on Sundays.

Yes?

Go on, Laz. You can talk to me.

You take her to a doctor?

Oh, she older than that.

This gonna get you in trouble?

You didn't have to do this.

Well. Hope you enjoy it.

You liked what I brung ya?

That'd be nice.

At church?

You gonna sing me somethin'?

Come on, just a little somethin'. Right here. Go'on now, don't be shy.

Hey. You wasn't at'cha work but that nosey gal up at the counter give me your home address. Hope you don't mind me comin' over.

Can I come in?

Laz... you don't need to explain yourself to me...

Why you stop havin' dancin' on Saturday? Used to have bands... all kind's live shit. Like a wake up in here, now.

Wanna get on somebody 'bout live music, get on ol' Laz, there. He the one got this place shakin' back in the day.

Hey.

No, ma'am.

That young lady's size, right'cher.

These are whipped body creams. It's like a lotion.

Some women prefer not to scent their bodies with perfume. So now they have scented creams. They help moisturize a woman's skin.  This one's my favorite. It's called Ginger Souffle. I recommend... applying the cream while the skin is still damp. So... perhaps just after a shower.

You gonna miss your bus.

Yeah.

Sure.

They been keepin' a folder on me cuz of my stomach. Like how it was just before we'd play ball back in school. Thought it was just some tic I got, or ulcers like my daddy had.  I can't... shoot. Target practice I'm a pro. I tag between the numbers each time but...  But when there's really loud noises around me... somethin' happens. I get shaky and... I lose my breath. They called it anxiety. Severe anxiety. It can be fixed and all... just not in time for....  It's a long process but... they sent me home.

She's around. Always is.

You been home yet?

You need a ride?

She ever tell you she was thinkin' of taking off?

That's not right, really, cuz I...

I know about how she was like. But we was different. I's the only person she talked to about it. How she's abused. Terrible things, Gill, just terrible...

It's not her fault, Gill. She's had to take care of me all this time, cuz I'd just start throwin' up... choking. Just losin' my grip. And she listened. She listened to me.  And... I got better. I don't get nervous like I used to. And since we been together... she been faithful to me. Put all that junk behind her...

Make yourself at home. You done it already.

Stop what?

I got others.

I begged him. Don't see why he had to go...

You don't got half what Tehronne got.

I begged him not to go. And he did.

It gets worse there. Leavin' me to my own mind. That's just not good.

Yeah.

Say what you gotta say, but I ain't gonna hear you speak his name to me. Not never. You hear?

Carryin' on behind my back. Make me out to look like a fool to all our people. Tell me, what's friendly about that?

Talk to me about sick. Ain't been right since I moved into that drafty house.

That damned, rusty, radiator, bout burned the skin off my legs each time I passed.

Better'n me?

Rose... please...

If we get with a counselor. At the church, maybe they's...

Let go of my arm...

LAZ, I said let...!

Don't you lay a CURSE ON ME!

Careful how you point that gun, boy.

You sayin' you'll do what?

BOY! You so green you couldn't stomp a baby duck.

Test. Shit. What kind'a test you thinkin'? You mean like, if you a man or not? If you a killer? Only one way to prove that. You just look me in the eye, boy, and you squeeze that trigger back.

BOY! YOU KEEP THAT GUN POINTED AT ME!  You need to kill a man, all you gotta have is a good reason.  You know she been here with me, don't cha? Been all over town, givin' up that switch you thought was your own.

Put all your love and dreams into one woman... she turn around and give it all to another man. That's a good reason to paint the wall with me, kid. She'd fear ya then. Cuz there won't be no more question in her mind. She with a real man now. A real KILLER!

Son, I'm grown. Don't got patience to suffer you children and this monkey junk. I'm too old to play house...  ...and cowboys. So let's have it. End me or get out of my face!

Yes. I mean that's it. I wanna feel like a man with her. I wanna feel like the only man with her.

How long... how long I been out?

Two days?

Well I don't...

Don't need none.

Think it'd be best if you stayed put while we talk.

Best try gettin' ya wits about you 'fore you try to...

The fuck you been doin' to me?

Get this Goddamn thing off me!

Well I'm woke now... you can take this off.

I'm right enough to stand on my own two feet. Now take this Goddamn chain off...

What?

Do me? Do me like this, you mean? Like chainin' me up?

The hell you know about me?! You got no right to talk to me about that shit! The hell you think you are?

WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?!  WHATEVER YOU GONNA DO TO ME, JUST DO IT! AND LET ME GO!

In my house, you watch that lip...

You sick. You got a sickness... we broke that fever... we gonna break that hold the devil got on ya.

You can holla y'self hoarse. Ain't gonna bend my will.  Right or wrong, you gonna mind me.  Gonna suffer you like Jesus say, to the FAITHLESS and the PERVERSE GENERATION.

Whose doin' is that?

You gonna get a lot more a'that, you keep me locked up like this!

Hm-mm... Hm-mm...

Can't sit all day on that sofa. Need to get your legs strong.

Itches.

Uh-uh.

I know. I get it. What's Matthew doin'?

Let go of me...

Uh-uh.

Look it... I put the Goddamn dress on, didn't I? I think I'm handlin' myself with some... fuckin' restraint here... how you got me locked up like a dog on a...

I can handle that.

Sure.

We drinkin' buddies now?

No joke.

I ain't in a hurry.

Anything.

I'm here with you.

The... chain helps.

No one's gonna hurt you no more.

I tried.

Nothin'.

By myself?

Yeah, gal I been here before.

Don't think that'd be wise.

I know you didn't. But you a grown girl. You can handle it. I got to.

Looks like you know a song.

Woke up real early. Sun was shining. Just thought I'd mess around, try to learn a song.

No, you do it. I can't sing.

I've had nice things before but I always ruined 'em somehow.

Maybe I won't.

Word wit'cha. In private.

Been years since I fooled with that.  You know a white girl? Dirty blond hair, split down the middle like?

Huh?

Now, hold up.

You collar that dog, boy. I ain't gonna hurt nobody. Just wanted to know who she was.

What I'm tellin' you. Girl gotta get dick or she go crazy.

What'chu sayin'?

Uh-huh.

Naw!

Nuh-uh.

Like I told you.

Don't see generosity much these days. Everything always got a catch. Guess I'm tryin' to say... thank you.

I never laid a hand on her in anger. Not a day. Not even when I's drinkin'. But this business got me wonderin' what a good shake and slap would do for her.

I didn't start this, R.L.

You gonna preach 'bout turnin' the other cheek?

He's fine. Just had a bad fall.

R.L., you gonna have to get on. I can't have nobody round my place.

This ain't got nothin' to do with that woman. Just don't want nobody around me now.

You gotta go, R.L.. I ain't foolin' this time.

Ain't gonna be moved?

Or what?

Man like you ought not take the Lord's name like you just done.

I haven't laid a hand. On my life, R.L., my wick is dry on this.

Put yo'self in my shoes. Say you out here, alone, with a beaten, half naked, white woman loves to fuck. I been toe to toe with the law in this town for no more than being black and nearby.

THIS IS HOW YOU HANDLING IT? THIS IS HOW YOU HANDLING IT?

You mean with you and that woman chained to ya radiator?

One thing at a time, Laz.

Y'all let me know if these steaks are too dry.

I'm dealin' with what God put before me.

Not like that.

She's tied to me, R.L.. We tied to each other.

What? I called Bojo, like you say. Called up the fellas in the band...

I just know how you get. Good to know, them butterflies still in ya gut.

I don't know, but I been told, them Georgia women sweet jelly roll.

I do.

Get me ten bags of mulch.

Naw... I got it, Mr. Lazarus.  You wanna tip me, best do it in butter beans. Momma say she need a bag 'a yours, none of that store-bought junk. That's what she said.

Why she got a chain on her?

Please don't tell my daddy.

Yes'sir.

Well, dig in, son. Got plenty to eat.

So he got it into his head that the only thing gonna keep you from endin' up bleedin' on the side of the road again, without a stitch of clothing on is...  You think he's crazy for thinkin' that?

That's right.

What's on your mind?

I'm gonna tell you somethin', and it's just gonna be between you and me.  I think folks carry on about heaven too much. Like it's some all-you-can- eat buffet up in the clouds. And folks just gonna do as they're told so they can eat what they want behind some pearly gates. I can go to Shoney's for that.

Rae, look at Ronnie. And tell him how you feel.

Rae...

Rae don't do this now...

Rae!

Hey.

You feelin' sick?

Yeah, I know.

Yeah?

Holy shit!

Holy shit, Ronnie!  You're a fuckin' rock star.

All them people shoutin' your name like they were doing tonight! Shit! That arm you got'll get'chu on a box of cereal...

Ronnie. Please, baby...

Ronnie...

I just like dressin' up in these goddamn blue vests.  Your money ticket get shipped today?

You need money again?

I'm workin' here, Rae. Can you see that?

All that shit's on aisle 5.

The hell are you talkin' about?

All my life I been puttin' out your fires, with you givin' out your snatch to every waggin' dick in this town. And you gonna lay the blame at my feet? Well, I ain't gonna take that.

Only thing I'm sorry for is listenin' to my parents and having you instead of doin' what I should'a done.

Thought you had a man for that.

What we just did, you askin' for money, make a man stop. I ain't callin' you no ho. But I ain't gonna be played like no trick, neither. Remember... you called me.

What'd I tell you?  I don't do none of that shit no more. I'm in communications now.

Just a cough. Sugar and a spoonful of Jack'll do it.

The hell you call me?

You want a popsicle, go to Good Humor.  And don't call me 'pappy.'

Thanks.

Home.

So why dive through the glass for a nickel and dime bust?

Let go...

Get rid of it.

It's not regulation.  And the only way you're gonna stop anybody with it is to show it to him, and while he's laughing, you can shove it down his throat.

Charlie...

-- I should tear your head off.

-- Hey, I got a better chance of being hit by a bus then moving up.

Eating Scungilli, just like the last time you asked.

What?

The Wolf?

Maybe we should do something?

I was thinking the Poconos, Charlie. Maybe Vegas.

Beats forty hours on a plane.

Not a prayer.

Where is the subway station, please.

No.

Number five with a bullet.

Go to sleep, Charlie.

I didn't know.

Hey, when in Rome --

Let's grab some food.

You said that in the last two places.

I hope not.

I'd feel better if we had some heat.

I don't think he'd feel it.

He couldn't find his ass with both hands.

Sure, a rice burning crotch rocket...

Cool?

What does Charlie mean?

Connie...

High spirits, desire, commitment.

Give me a break, would you?

Where would you look for the mafia?

The mayor's office, under the bed, the back room at Lombardi's.  And call me Ich.

Jerry Lee Lewis, Elvis, Dinky Doo And The Don't's.  Let's book, Charlie.  If he starts on Motown, we'll be here all night.

That's what you said in the last three piss pots.

What's the problem here?

Give us a break...

Leave the rice cake outside and go home!

I don't deserve Ohashi's respect.

I don't, that's all.

They made you leave your hotel...  ... you caused a disturbance.

Yeah...

I can see that.

We can ask someone I used to work with.  A criminal.  Someone I pay money to...

Only one way to find out... Get her up in the morning and put her to bed at night.

No.  Don't say anything.  Don't do anything, and for Christ's sake, don't apologize!

There she is!

Sure.

If you're gonna give me a hard time, wait outside.

Four goddamn days.  This is going nowhere...

Ichiro --

Good.  Very good...

Gaiijin.

You can trust me.

We're through.  I mean it.  This is the end of the line, Matsumoto.

Shut-up.

I want to yank Kobo.

San is an honorable title.

A few minutes faster, we might've nailed him.

A resort city, Beppu.

What...?  Why?

He'll never speak to a Gaiijin.

Big enough.

It's a new deal.  ... coming with me tomorrow?

For Sugai.  Caviar, French cheese, ham... If you come to apologize for interrupting his meeting, Sugai may feel obligated to see you.

It's done.  You don't have to come.

No.

I can't...

Kampai.

I called Ohashi, he'll be waiting.  I like him waiting.

I followed them.  An hour from the train station.

I couldn't tell.

I don't know.

Now we've got nothing to negotiate with.

A wife.  She left.

Me too.

Why's that?

We can't lose.

He gets as much as he wants.

There was a change in plans.

You have a helluva way of asking for help.

Maybe I'm a quicker learner.

He's on duty.

Somebody must be suffering somewhere, you're being so nice.

Where's Ich?

I need someone to translate for me.

You could fake it.

He drinks.

You met her.

What do you chant?

I don't remember you saying no.

Tell them I'm not.

The cheese...

Why would you care?

What if I chant?

Maybe.  If I come visit, we can find out.

I'm taking you back.

Save it, I already took the tour.

Time, I've got plenty of.

I'm amused.

Then take it from him.

This by this...

Not in that company.

Yeah.

Why?

What?

What...?  What if I say no?

Why me?

He was my partner.

I planned on catching him, Captain.

He killed a police officer.

Right.

You're foreigners.

Do you know what this is?

Why don't you ask your chief detective?

The young are eating the old, something that usually doesn't happen here.

Your visa has expired.  Be on a plane in twenty-four hours or you will be deported.

Look.

For God's sake, Ohashi, I need your help.  Let me out of here!

If anything happens to her while I'm here --

I have to get to Sugai.

I'm impressed.  But let's use the short form.  I'm looking for --

I want him.

The families who control the casinos?

The Feds would be onto you in a month.

The other plate is currently in New York, in the hands of Kobo's man. Find it for me.

I'll pay you.

Swiss bank deposit.  Gold bullion. Whatever you want.  You know the city and the police.

You're smarter than Kobo.  You know the price of deceit.  Think about it.

He'll find out you took me.  I'm unprotected.  He'll kill us.  All of us.  You don't stand a chance.

You want him dead too.

We were worried to death.  It's awfully kind of you.

You certainly have a nice place here.

If he won't cooperate?

I don't think there is another human being in this whole world who would have helped us.

Where?

Not to be trapped.

Then go get him.

Oh?

Had in mind something a little more radical.

Come here.

Why?

What about E.M.S. recombination?

Wouldn't obstruct replication, but it does give rise to an error in replication, so that the newly formed DNA strand carries a mutation and you're got a virus again... but all this is academic -- you are made as good as we could make you.

Put it this way.  Rolls Royces are made to last -- as least they were. But I'm afraid you're a Ferrari. A high strung racing car -- built to win, not to last.

I am?

Also extraordinary things.

Well, no, not really.  There's Mr. Deetchum, he's the watchman, he lives on the first floor.

Well, actually

You're just all so... so different.

You're androids.

Nexus - 6.

You mean that you can't come here and I can't go there?

Of course not.

I don't know much about biomechanics, Roy.  I wish I did, but you're out of my league.

Tyrell could help us, Sebastian.

His company made us.

Be better if I could talk to him in person.  But he's not an easy man to get to.

When do you deliver your project?

Just thought I'd...

He's not ready yet.

Tomorrow, he says.

Hello, glad to meet you.

Not if everybody is doing their job here at home.  How are things at home?

Five.  Three nights ago one of them managed to break into the Tyrell Corporation.  Killed two guards and got as far as the Genetic Sector before he got fried going through an electro- field.

There wasn't much left of him, so we can't be sure.  But bio- chemical data and morphology records of the Nexus-6 were reported missing.  Going on the possibility they might try to infiltrate we send Holden in to run Voight-Kampff tests on the new employees.  Guess he found himself one.

We're using Esper -- a 231 -- that picked up Holden's alarm.  Its guess is that all five are in the city.

What was the cover on the one that got Holden?

Bryant here.  Regarding the rundown you requested on job applicants, Esper's concluded that the only irregular category that Tyrell's got is the entertainment section.  You better get on it.

You didn't like her!?

This is Bryant.  Are you alone?

Got it.

Yeah.  I got it.

Your customer, eh?

Soon as I finish the job.

Day after tomorrow.

This is Esper and I'm ready.  Go ahead please.

Why, yes, of course.

The five in question are third generation Nexus Sixes, constructed of skin-flesh culture, selected enogenic transfer conversion capable of self-perpetuating thought, para-physical abilities and developed for emigration program.  Are you with me?

Unlike a five, they can sustain massive traumas to several parts of the body without debilitating another.  Sever a leg and it will perform quicker on the remaining leg than the fastest man can run,

I'm coming to that.  Vulnerable zone is the base of the skull, the occipital bone.  A direct hit is a positive retirement.

Do you have something against science?

And what in your estimation works?

It's okay.  Forget it.

I'll but you one.  What'll you have?

Shot of vodka, please.

My pleasure.

Prosit.

Sorry, don't have the time.

Ya.

Two months.  But this one is not guy.  It is girl.  His girl.

Prosit.

No thanks.

I like you too.

I gotta piss.

Well, you don't have to worry about getting it wrinkled.

Sorry.

I'm doing okay.

No.  I got a problem.

I'm taking a piss.

These aren't just...

No rust?

Meaning?

Yeah?

Nope.

Listen, I could make you a long list of complaints about this fucken city but I still rather be here than up there.

Me too.

Yes?

Of course.

Do you recognize any of them?

What did she want?

What night?

You talking about the Opera House on the Main?

Lots of places.  The tours, the clubs, the Silicone shows, private parties.

Silicone Valley.  Lots of these science guys never leave that place.  We book two shows a month in there. Those big time techs and bio- guys might be real high zoners up here, but when it comes to the arts, they like it loud and lewd.

I'm with the American Federation of Variety Artists...

I don't know nothing about it.

Like to get this position.  Did you or were you asked to do anything lewd or unsavory or otherwise repulsive to your person?

For holes.

You mean the snake.

Does it eat?

Sorry.

And who do I go to about you?

A humanoid robot is like any other machine, it can be a benefit or a hazard.  If it's a benefit, it's not our problem.

Of course not.

Why should I be?

You have a little boy.  He shows you his butterfly collection, plus the killing jar.

Is this testing whether I'm an android or a lesbian?

It would be my child.

I know you think it complicates your work, but I'm here to help.

I think you need more help than you've got.

Sounds like I'm an ass-hole either way, but the answer is still no.

I work alone.

So?

Yeah.

Right.

What do you want me to do?

There's a lot I haven't done with a man before.

Me and my dad.

Dead.

I am.  Part of my job is to sit on a couch and try and figure things out.

Not too good.

If they are smart, they take naps.

Yeah.

What?

Like?

Hmmm?

Don't be fooled by appearances.

I don't like people snooping around my stuff.

Never mind the plug, just go through the motions.

Good for a smart girl to feel stupid.  Part of your education.

I never felt better.

You mean a woman?

What's a long time?

Nope.  Nobody could stand me that long.

Because it's not.

Andies only simulate suffering -- if they're programmed for it.

No, I don't.

What?

You know where I been.  I been on vacation.

What's up?

Severed spine.  You'd better get in here.  Bryant's waiting for you.

Yes.

Go ahead.

No.

One that relies on human interpretation.  Where's the subject?

If she is, the machine works.

Thirteen.

Memory implant.  She was programmed. But I think she has transcended her conditioning.  I think she was beginning to suspect.

Five, maybe six.

I'm tired of this.

Don't move.

What one?

What desert?

But how come I'd be there?

A tortoise.  What's that?

Of course.

I mean you're not helping! Why is that, Leon?

I was tired and didn't have any place to go.

Pris.

I don't have one.

They left.

I have some, but I have to find out where they are staying.

We sure did.

You scared me.

Yeah, I live here pretty much alone right now...

What's your problem?

What's that?

Is that why you're still here?

As a matter of fact I did.  They've got some work to do tonight, but they're gonna come tomorrow.

I keep a lot of provisions right here.

You're all so perfect.

Yes?

Thank-Q!

I'm Adam Webber.

Really?

She is a dancer! And a lovely one! You would like her very much! Shall we dance?

How do you do?

Fallout shelter. There's a difference.

Come where?

For how long?

I thank you very much for the invitation, but I'm quite busy today. Perhaps I could see you tomorrow.

Yes, ma'am.

Young man, stop right there!

I do fine, Adam.  How 'bout yourself?  You doin' any good?

Thank you very much. But, Cliff, that's my seat. And I was just--

Oh, brother...

Shallow? I'm shallow?!

Do ya?

It certainly is.  I agree with you completely.

Are you French?

Yes, ma'am.  But my name is Adam.

We? I'm going home. And, judging by that coat, I'd say you have to get back to the barber college.

You're lost?

Forget it.  I'm sick of working for that dickhead.

A walking penis capable of intelligent speech.  A dickhead.

Why doesn't that surprise me?

Yes, I'm right?

I knew it! So anyhow, you get on a bus and before you know it, you're out here in the San Fernando Valley without a clue.  Which brings us to here.  Correct again?

Where are you staying? The Holiday Inn?

Yeah. Thanks. Anyhow, let me predict a bus for you to get on.

I'm not taking you there, Sweetie. Rule Number One in North America: No strangers in the car.

You don't?

Get away from me!!

Rogers Hornsby?!?

So what?!  I've got two of him!  And this many DiMaggios and Robinsons. I was holding these out, too.

Yes.

Yes.

Heck, no!  What?!

It's Webber.  Adam Webber.

What is it?!

Perry?

Okay, okay!  Take it easy!

Yeah! Listen to this part. This is where it really takes off!

I can't help it. Perry Como always does this to me! I just get so cranked!

Okay, down boy.  I can't take this for driving you home. I wish I could, but I can't. So here, take it back. I could have just left it for you at the desk, but it's very valuable. Now take it.

Take it. damn it!

I haven't brushed yet.

Please don't follow me.  Don't do it!

Can't you please just talk to me for one second?

No.

Oh, stop that!  God! Listen, I know you like me.  I can tell. But you know what? A lot of guys like me.  Not me, exactly. It's more like the legs or the butt or the hair.  Or some combination of the above.

The eyes.  Okay. An eye-man.  Anyhow, it never works out.  Okay?  Not that you even need to know that!  You look like crap, by the way.  What have you been doing?

Hey, no kidding?  In color?

Why doesn't it never work out?

It never works out because I'm into legs and butts and hair myself! That's why! So I wind up with guys who are very good looking, but even more shallow than I am, if you can picture that. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go find another low-paying, demeaning job where some guy named Jerry keeps telling me how lousy his marriage is.

Doing what?

Food and supplies?  Who for?  Like starving people?

How long would you need me?

My Mom and Dad.

Hey!  Pipe tobacco!  I'm going to need all of this! This is swell!

What?

Sorry.

Hey, you know. I was thinking...

It's your life.  And, by the way, it's a dandy.

And, um ...I guess... I guess you and I, uh...

Name it.

Oh, I'm sure it will!

No, no!  I'm sorry!  What is it?

A wife?

What for?

Why?!

You can be single and not alone. Marriage bites!

Sure.

Everybody knows that. Ask my divorced sisters. Or ask my divorced mom and dad.

Everybody's divorced.

No dogs, huh? Okay.

That's what I was afraid of.

Of course.

The engine is still running.

Yes, ma'am!

Sorry!

I told you I've never driven before!

Is this your house?

What?!

Thank-Q!

Well, I know Mom sure likes 'em!

Yes!

Wow.

Good for you.

He's gone to check your answers on his computer.

Sure.

Uh...yeah.

So, what are you seeing?

Wazoo!  Try to listen.  Whataya think? Surfer, grunge, hip- hop, Euro trash?

That's boring!

Yeah.

It's fine. Just give it a try. And for gosh sake, Eve, take your foot off the chair!

Okay!

Have you ever heard the saying, "He hasn't got enough sense to come in out of the rain?"

Yeah? No kidding. Listen, you still want to go girl hunting tonight?

Okay. But you know, this business of finding you a wife -- it's kind of ridiculous, don't you think?

Yes it is. A girlfriend maybe. But a wife? I mean...

Hey, screw you! Okay? You think I'm just somebody you can buy off! Listen, let me tell you something--

Well...yeah. Okay.

Look unimpressed.

Do I look crazy?

Good-bye!

Not that one!

And don't be so obvious!

It's a Rob Roy. A very popular drink, I'm told.

No way.

Adam!  She's got bitch written all over her!  You do know what "bitch" means, don't you?

Because we're bitches!  Look at her! Look at the expression on her face! The walk, the jewelry, the fingernails.  Please!

Yeah, sweet.  That's a nice way of putting it.

Yes, really! Basically, they want what they think they can't have.  Same with guys.  That's why everybody is walking around here sending off "you can't have me" signals!

Maybe. But that's how it works.

Romeo and Juliet. I cried at the end.

You're not from Alaska!  Where'd you learn to dance like that?!  And there are no starving people, are there?!

Don't change the subject! I want you to tell me the truth about yourself.

You think I'm some sort of sap?! Don't you?!

I want to know exactly who you are and what you're really up to!

But, Eve, I would--

Scare me, why don't you?!!?  You stupid son of a bitch!!!

Well, you should be!  Thanks to you, my heart is in my neck!

Goodnight!

Look! I'm limping!  How attractive is that?!  What if this is for life?!

Thanks.

Is that what you call it?

Sing it to me.

No.

Yes, Eve?

Of course.  I shouldn't be over here at this hour.

Not at all.  And Eve thank you for tonight...and for the kiss. My first.

It was at least as good as the sky.

And I think better than the ocean. I'm serious!

Hi, Adam.  This is, uh....

See! I can't tell them that!  I can't ever let them know. It makes their life..well, frankly... a joke.  I can't let that happen.  You understand?

My mother's like that.

Yes, it is.

What?

Fill this out please. And I'll need a card.

Yes, sir.

Yes!  Yes!  Oh, Lord!  Yes, oh, yes! But  where is the one who came last night -- all in yellow?!

Ooooohhhh!!  Of course! The father! Forgive me!!  Can you forgive me for my wasted life?!  Everything has been so awful!!

Yes.

Of course you do.  I'll stay here and pray.

No. I don't need money anymore -- I see that now.

Archbishop Melker. We met earlier.

They're pretty.  Can I have them?

Latin exam, Dad.  It's Tuesday.

Tempus fugit!

Gerade aus dann links!

Haben sie etuas nettes in leder?!

It's my entire baseball collection. It's yours now.

It's a game, son. I can explain it pretty easily. There's a pitcher.

Uh, no. There's a man who throws the ball -- to a man who has a bat.

No. Sit down.

Why?

Then why go there?

Blow out the candles!

Your roller-skates! I redesigned them! I think this new design will work even better!

No, son! We wait for night.  Now...is precisely when... we must be at our... most cautious.

Shit is a French word?

Yes, father?! Yes?

Yes, sir.  Is that all?

Adult Bookstore.  Why?

I promise. Is that all?

I'll try.

And, I'm asking you to trust me without understanding why.

It's Ukrainian. Her grandparents immigrated here.

Dad, I don't know how to tell you this. And I was going to wait a while, but I think...Dad,there was no bomb. A plane crashed into our backyard. I looked it up in old newspapers.

Positive. The Soviet Union collapsed without a shot being fired. The Cold War is over.

Yes, sir. It's true.

Yes. That's kind of how it was.

Uh, I think they have.

I do? Well, thank you! You like ceilings?

Well, I hope you like these! Fresh sea urchin wrapped in seaweed. Or "nori" if you prefer. I love sushi.

You nut!

And it's called...?

Really?  Since when?

Well, Dionne Warwick, guess his home town.

I've never met anyone like you in my life.

Why not just go to... Nome for supplies and a wife?  Isn't that closer?

1959.

Russia.

1867.  Seward's Folly. We paid 7.2 million dollars for it. A tidy sum then, as well as now. I'm quoting my father, of course.

Juneau.

Sorry, that's the largest city.

What are you talking about? This is the new Mac. You a hacker?

You don't have a computer in your cabin?

How do you get through those winters?  Well, you're right.  Juneau.  What's the highest peak?

Okay, maybe she is psychic.  Let's go eat!

Yeah?

He's a Windows guy then, huh?

Well, I think Windows stink. What do you think of that?

True.

I'm not wearing his pants.

I just don't want to.

No.

Almost all of them.

I LOVE THIS!!

Miss Rustokov refuses to let total strangers drive her car.

Ladies first, Troy! That was close.

Okay. Thank you, my friends.

I know what you mean!  I usually wear a big hat and dark glasses.

Yeah...Seems to.

What?

Of what?

I see.  Well, thank you very much. You've been very, very nice.

My father is a genius.

Good night!  Sleep tight.  Don't let the bedbugs bite!  That's what my Mom always says...  ...who I'm really beginning to miss. I'm sorry.  It's my first night away from home.

How old do I look?

I guess living up here makes people look older.

Yes. Up here on the fifteenth floor. Goodnight.

The sky!!!

Up there!!

Just look!!

Yes, please.  I'm looking for all beef patties.

Frozen, they're six-thirty a dozen in the three pound box.

You could have a meat order that big delivered to your home.

Well, that's great then! Terrific...except...it just occurred to me. I don't know where I live! I'm lost! I don't know where home is!  Would you excuse me?

How do you do, ma'am.

Good!

Hi.

I was thinking of selling all the cards.

Hey, smart ass, how 'bout I kick your butt?

Yes, ma'am.

Sorry, Mom!

Oh, no! Oh, my goodness!   Let's get him into the bedroom.

I'll go up.

Yes, ma'am.

I just hope this is still good up there.

I was thinking that, uh...you know, while I was up there and all...that maybe I could, you know...try to meet a girl.  I've, been thinking about that a little...just these last...fifteen years or so.

Yes, ma'am.

Yes, ma'am.

Heck, I know that mom! You're my parents.

Are you in trouble, son?!

A psychiatrist?!

No, wait! At least stay for dinner!

No, Mom, I've turned it into Dad's office.

Eve and I...eloped.  We're married.

Yes.

He'll catch him.  Hi. This is Nina Aron.  I've got a run away and I'm going to need police assistance.

I have to. If a complaint is made and the person resists obser--

Calm down, please. This man needs help and you need protection from him. That's obvious.

Let's all remain calm. That's the key thing.

Well, he and Mrs. Nutcase must have been out here when the plane hit.

What about relatives?

The neighbors over there said the guy spent day and night out here. She'd bring him sandwiches and hot Dr. Pepper.

Yeah.

Yeah.

What?!  A light!  Yes, I've got a light!

The blast?  Honey, I have survived a host of things. Like the song says: "A country boy can survive!"

"Hell up here?"  Honey, it's been hell up here, down there and over yonder! Hell everywhere.

Sorry, honey!  I just got to fooling with this darn rheostat.

You bet, hon!

Time? Oh, no Calvin. It's not time yet. I still have--

Did you rig it to do that? You're so clever.

I never know anymore.

Yes.

I just hope those plates aren't radioactive by tomorrow morning.

Yeah, yeah. Okay.  Give me the roast and watch your step.  I'll come back for the radio.

I don't know. For this thing to blow over, it could take days.

I've read up on it. I'll deliver the baby myself if I have to.

Yes, dear!

The locks.

To keep us from trying to leave. After an atomic blast there's a radiation half-life that lasts thirty five years.

Then after that it's safe.

To go up.

No.

All our friends...

I'm not hungry.

How could you?! This is just like home!

Would you like a tranquilizer?

Honey?

No, Calvin.  Babies cry.

What shall we call him?

If I...you know...

Right here!

No reason.  Well, it's pretty clear that the front entrance caved in when the bomb went off. So, you know, when the time is up, we'll have to return to the surface using, you know, this back entrance.  Which is very nice because it has the service elevator!

Yes.  Well... yes.

What?

Yes, he's very bright, dear. Much like his father. But you know, Calvin, maybe he's a little...young for school.

Oh, Calvin, I'm not sure we should be making promises that perhaps can't be kept.

Hi.

Coming!

You bet.

And I made these!

If he tells, it won't come true!

Well, we did in my family!

Calvin Webber! What a thing to say!

Yeah. Let's dig in!

Yes...

Would you excuse me?

Oh, yes.  It just fascinates me how all    these things work.

Just open the door.

It's an archaic colloquialism, roughly meaning..."good".

Mutants?!

No.

I don't believe it!

We do?

Excuse me.

Well, I am the head of this household--

--and we will--

--do as I say!

Yes, dear, I know.

Amen.

To keep what's up there from getting down here! It's not the radiation I'm worried about.

Some time.

What are you doing here?

Your stuff?  Let me see that.

Hey, they're Ralph Laurens.  And who's this interesting looking fellow?

You know, I don't know.  And looking at you, I don't care.  It's been too long, Eve.

Yeah. Before I kick your ass.

I guess we shouldn't fight in here.

I knew you'd like him.

Out-of-town.  That's all he'll say.

What's that supposed to mean?

Well, that's blunt!

And I suppose you see him in some sort of strapless  thing, don't you?

Yeah? Like Ralph Lauren?

I'm busy tomorrow anyway. I have to buy six thousand paper napkins.

I think...it...works.

No.

He's from Alaska.

Always good advice.

Eve?!

Right here?  Well, you're being so bossy I wasn't sure!

Uh..he might of.

We did not leave together.

I'm his pimp. He left with the dancers, didn't he?

To bed.

Yeah.  I'm not the one who's in love with the guy.

Yes, you do.

Uh, yes, you do.

Yes, you do!

You know, I asked him about that. And he said that good manners are a way we have of showing other people that we respect them. See, you'd eat like a slob if you were alone, but since another human being is present, you show that person respect by going to the trouble of having proper manners. I didn't know that. I thought it was a way of appearing superior.  Know what else he told me?

He thinks that I am a gentleman and that you are a lady!

Exactly! I thought a gentleman was somebody who owned horses. Turns out, the short and very simple definition of a gentleman or a lady is: someone who always attempts to make the people around him or her feel as comfortable as possible. That's it! If you don't do that, nothing else matters. The cars, the clothes, the houses...

He didn't leave with them.

It's true.  She swept him out the door whispering little French things into his ear.

You're goddamn right I am!

Coward!

What?!

Give it back to him.

We'll find him.

Have him committed.

He was always so "nice"! How was I supposed to know that's a good thing?! "Nice" is weird! Nice is...what is "nice"? It's not cool! I'll tell you that.  Was it ever?

Well, at least I fell for him before I found out he was rich! That's new.  Wait a minute! He said today he knew where home was. What happened this morning?! Where did you go?!

Then what?

You didn't stop anywhere else?!

What?!

Come on.

None of this stuff was here in 1962. The Valley was mostly small homes and fruit orchards.

Yeah.  Maybe he'll call.

Where?!

You bet, Mom! Coming up!

Uh...yeah. It's like hard.

Um...uh...

Could I, like...oh, wow...like,uh...

Yeah!  Yeah, that's it!

I've got secondaries of an engine fire and I'll need to find a clear area to eject.

The SAR HELO is airborne with you in sight.

Roger, Wolf One.

You look good, Jeffrey. Did you have a nice flight?

Aunt Barbara. I'll try not to get depressed.

No, I'm just going to walk around the neighborhood. Don't worry.

I'm not sick.

Okay honey. That sounds nice. Jeffrey. I think you've got termites in the house.

I've seen a few.

Okay honey.

Hey, I brought some friends. And some beer.

Certainly Frank.  Darling, get some glasses. We'll have some beer with Frank. Won't you sit down?

Fine Frank. Fine. How are you?

Darling, where are the glasses? Oh, here they are.

Shit. Let's drink to something else. Let's drink to fuckin'. Say here's to your fuck Frank.

EXCUSE US por favor! Hey. Let Tits see her kid.

Right Ben. LET'S GO FUCK. I'll fuck anything that moves.

Yes.

Sure I do. I understand he's in the hospital. How is he?

You did? A human ear?

Yep, that's right. Let's take a look at it.

Got it. Thanks for letting me in on as much as you did.

Excuse me, Mrs. Williams.

I understand. I'm just real curious like you said.

It must be great.

Okay.

The criminals are winning.

Yes.

I won't let the bastards get me up against the wall. It's an act of defiance.

Blue. It's Blue Velvet.

It's blue. Blue velvet.

Hi. Hi Sandy. I'm sorry to bother you, but I've got to talk to you.

I can't tell you the whole story. I. I took it upon myself. I can't say more.

No, not at all.

Only you and the photo lab.

Yes sir. I sure am.

Detective Williams here. Is that you, Jeffrey?

We're ten minutes away and moving as fast as we can.

Does Dorothy know her husband is dead?

Oh my God. Is her son OK?

Pest control, gotta do your apartment.

Nope, it's new stuff. No smell.

Yeah.

Jeffrey nothing.

I wanted to see you.

Nobody.

I sprayed your apartment. I took your key. I really didn't mean to do anything but see you.

I saw you come in, talk on the phone. Get undressed.

You said hello, to Frank. You wanted to talk to someone? Don? And little Donny. You said something about Momma loves you. And something about a Meadow Lane. Something in an hour. I don't remember any more.

Well.

Then you got undressed.

Never before this.

Yes.

No.

Nothing. Are you alright?

I'll go then.

No.

It's okay. It's okay.

Yes.

You can kiss them if you want. Feel them. They're getting hard.

No, please. I won't.

Yes, I like you.

Do you know?

You don't?

Maybe you don't know. I know you though. You're Jeffrey Beaumont and I know where you live and I know ways to get you and I know ways to kill you.

Did I say that? I didn't mean it, or did I?  Sometimes I think it would be fun.  Go ahead, you better leave now. I can't open myself to you now. I'll tell you a little secret.  I want to die.

It's a secret so don't tell anyone. Some day I'll show you where. I've gotta go to sleep now.

Yeah, hurry up though.

I, uh.

That's not crazy. I like you too.

Same here.

Who's it, you mean.

There you go again. Stop saying that. You can make it.

Take it easy. What's goin' on anyway? Why are you in so much trouble?

No.

No. Please, Dorothy. Why are you in so much trouble?

Don? Are you in with them?

Who are you? Maybe I'll need to. You like me, huh?

Please, please stay.

Hello.

I'm sorry, maybe I better go Dorothy.

Frank is coming?

I sure don't hate you.

That's good.

I'm doing it.

What do you want?

No. I told you. I don't want to hurt you. I want to help you. I think I know some of what is happening to you.  Dorothy? Frank has your husband and son. Dorothy? Doesn't he? You have to do something Dorothy. Go to the police.

Yes.

Frank would open you.

Does that scare you?

What if Frank came over here and found us?

Kiss me.

Do you love me?

Just get outta my bed.

No, it's not Don.

Shhhhhh. Now I have your disease.

Men are crazy. Then they put their craziness into me. Then it makes me crazy. Then they aren't so crazy for awhile. Then they put their craziness in me again.  It's burning me, but I love you. I do, I do. Did you know that? Did you know that I love you?

There's so much I want to tell you. I'm in so much darkness though with things moving. There is darkness sucking me. It's kissing me and darkness is entering me. In every hole. It's opening me to a death.

If I die, then they'll be free. It's getting late, isn't it? I can tell, it's a cold feeling when it's late. It's warm then it gets cold. Jeffrey. I feel it getting cold.

Why are you here?  HMMMMMMMM!!!! OK.

Okay. Soon? Do you think I'm too fat?

I'm getting a little bit fat. I hate that.

No.  Hi baby.

Oh God, Jeffrey, is that you? Oh God.

It's okay. It's okay.

Who, Dorothy?

Don? Where is he?

Yeah, but get outta here. He's comin' back.

Alright, suit yourself.

'Cause he's comin' back, that's what for. Frank's got you really loaded tonight.

Oh he forced you, huh?

No way, get out. I'm gonna tell Frank. I'm gonna tell him what you said.

Shut up. It's daddy, shit-head.

My bourbon.

Mommy's here.

He's a friend. From the neighborhood. We were just talking.

Hey Tits, I'm taking your neighbor to the country. Maybe something for you too.

Then, shut up!

Come on, Frank. Let's go. Please.

Those are my breasts.

Shut up. Gimme your lipstick.  Hey, pretty, pretty.

He became obsessed with her. She hated him. He had to have her. He kidnapped them to control her. To make her do things. Then she wanted to commit suicide so he started cutting off ears as a warning to her to stay alive. I'm not kidding. Frank loved blue, blue velvet. He had to have Dorothy cause her whole life was blue.

Yeah. I sure know that. Yeah, but how many more are out there?

Go where?

A ride? Hell, that's a good idea. Okay, let's go. Hey, let's go.

FUCK THAT SHIT. PABST BLUE RIBBON!!!

Here's to Ben.

Nothing.

Yes.

Okay Frank.

For good? I can't Mom. Not right in the middle of the term.

Mom.

I've made arrangements with Dr. Gynde for 10:30. But Jeffrey, you'll have to walk over; I need the car this morning.

Jeffrey, when you see your father.

He doesn't know you're out of school. He thinks it's a vacation for you.

It would be too much for him. So please let him think as he does, that you're home just to see him.

Jeffrey! Nobody wanted you to leave school and go to work in the store, maybe going back to school will be an option one day. I hope so.

Do you want the car?

Alright.

You can't just stay out half the night and carry on, Jeffrey. There's got to be some order, Jeffrey. I thought it would have been nice to call your father when you got home but now it is much too late.

Oh, yes, Jeffrey. Come in. He'll be back any minute now. You're welcome to wait. Is it urgent?

Really, he'll be home soon, would you like a cup of coffee?

Yeah, I know.

No. No thank you.

Yeah. okay.

Yeah.

Oh, you're welcome. Nice to finally meet you, Jeffrey.

That sounds great!

Sure thing, please don't worry about me. Can I help you with the dishes?

I'll get a coat for her.

Looks like you'd make a good runner.

Well, most guys don't. I mean that's the point. You all mind if I take my vitamins?

Later Mike. I gotta take care of someone who's hurt here, in case you haven't noticed.

Hey Jeff.

Uh-uh.

Uh-uh.

It's good to see you, Dad.

Hey Jeff. I'm feelin' so much better.

I just know, that's all. I remember you from Central.

Am I bothering you?

Yes.

Yeah. What are you doing now?

That's too bad.

Didn't my father tell you not to talk about it? 

I don't really know much but bits and pieces. I hear things. My room is right above my father's office. The ear, there's no corpse in the morgue missing an ear, and it did come off a living person. That's direct from the Coroner's Office. The person is unknown. There are a couple of cases I get mixed up on, but I think there are some people who were brought in for questioning on a murder case that could have something to do with the ear. I heard some of the same names.

There were at least three, maybe four. But a name that keeps coming up is this woman who lives in an apartment building very close to your house and also close to the field where you found the ear. There's also a business man over by the Franklin factory district that was questioned. And a musician. And some others.

No, this has been going on for some time. Several months. About six months ago some parts of bodies were found down by the river. They were from people who were reported missing. They never found one complete body, only parts.

Maybe so.

Yeah. It's close by, that's what's creepy. They've had her under surveillance for a couple of months, except I don't know what they've found out because my father isn't in charge of her.

Not really, why?  You want to see the building? Come on, I'll show you.

Where are they?

My father is watching the businessman. The businessman had a partner who disappeared. Left his whole business and family, his wife and two kids. They think he's been murdered.

Yeah, I guess so.  What are you going to do now that you're home?

Still, it must be kinda rough.

I don't know. He moved away.

Thanks for the tour. It was nice talking to you.

I guess so. Like you said. It's a strange world.

I don't know.

Just a minute, pull over and wait a minute.

I'm here, aren't I?

Ooooo, you are smart. Just don't get too smart.

There are opportunities in life for gaining knowledge and experience. Sometimes, in some cases, it's necessary to take a risk. I got to thinking. I'll bet a person could learn a lot by getting into that woman's apartment, you know, sneak in and hide and observe.

Alright. the first thing is to get into her apartment and open a window that I could crawl into later.

Right out in the car I happen to have some old overalls and a bug spraying rig. I will go to her apartment and be the pest control man. I will spray her apartment. After a few minutes you will knock on her door, drawing her attention away from me and I will then jimmy a window.

You will be a Jehovah's Witness. I have a few "Awake" magazines for you. You don't have to keep her very long. A few seconds is all I'll need. Whatiya think?

Let's just try the first part. If that goes well, we'll see about the rest. No one will suspect us, because no one would believe two people like us would be crazy enough to do something like this.

Alright.

Oh brother. Dorothy Vallens, Seventh Floor. Look on the mailbox for her number, bright boy.

Yeah, let's get outta here. What happened?

Yes and no. Did you recognize him?

Yeah.

Pretty clever. Are you game for more?

You didn't goof it up, but you still owe me one. I want to sneak in tonight. It's Friday, do you have a date tonight?

I don't want you to get involved, really, I mean, I do, but if something went wrong I mean, like you said, they may be involved in murder.

First of all, we'll have a nice dinner. Try to find out where Dorothy sings.

Great. I'll pick you up around eight o'clock. Is that good?

Okay. You better get out before someone sees us.

First of all, we're going to the Slow Club to see Dorothy Vallens. We'll watch her for awhile. I'd like to hear her sing anyway, and then also we'll know she is there and not in her apartment.

Then we'll drive back to her apartment and I will plant myself there.

Why not?

It'll be okay. I don't think you should wait out here though. I think you should go home. Can you drive this car?

Leave it in the front of your house for me, okay?

Could you wait a little while, this key may not fit.

Oh, okay, can I call?

Yeah.

Are you sure?

I don't know if you're a detective or a pervert.

Okay, okay. Bye.

Well, I've found out some things, nothing really for certain. There are some strange people involved.

Well.  Maybe we should discuss this somewhere else, you know what I mean?

He got a little jealous.

No way. I'm about to blow up.

OK. It's a strange world, Sandy. This is what I have found out. What I think I have found out. Dorothy Vallens is married to a man named Don. They have a son. I think the son and the husband have been kidnapped by a man named Frank who has now cut off both of Don's ears. I think he is holding them to make her do things for him. I think she wants to die. The ears were for her a warning to stay alive. There is another man involved. I call him the "yellow man". You saw his back the other day in the hall at her door. I don't know what he does but I think he's on drugs supplied by Frank. Frank is a very dangerous man.

I don't see how I can, and I can't prove any of this. I got all this information illegally. Also it could get you in trouble.

Actually. I've been in twice.

Yes.

Yeah. I mean a little, you know.

That doesn't bother you, does it?

That's what I thought.

Why are there people like Frank. Why is there so much trouble in this world?

Okay, Sandy.

You better not, Jeffrey.

Goodnight.

I'm really sorry.

You want to go talk to him?

That's what makes it so good. You wanta hear what I saw today?

Number one. I saw the Yellow Man go into Frank's building, laughing with Frank. Now, the only trouble is, what does this prove?

Maybe. But I think the Yellow Man is on drugs. I think Frank supplies him.

Number two. I saw the Yellow Man come out. This time with a well- dressed man with an alligator briefcase. They drove down this factory building and stood on a staircase looking at something in the distance. Number three. Now get this. In the distance was a murder. A drug dealer shot to death and a woman with her legs broken.

Then these guys told me the police will find a huge amount of drugs inside the dead man's place.

Yeah.

Yeah, you're a mystery. I like you. Very much.

Yes. Is that so surprising? Yeah I worry, a lot. I got you into this.

Jeffrey, are they important things? Well forget me - you have to tell him. Jeffrey, I mean it.

Yeah. I think so. I just had to tell him some of what I knew. Is Friday still on?

No.

Okay. Great!

What is it?

Where to?

I'd rather not talk about it. I'll tell you about it sometime.

I like that idea, that's a real good idea.

I can't dance fast.

Frank!!!

Dorothy Vallens?

No. Is Detective Gordon going to be at your house?

Okay. Let's get her over to your father's.

Shhh. I'll tell you.

Go ahead.

No Jeffrey!!

Yeah. I just saw him outside. Maybe the robins are here.

You can change it if you want to.

Mike. We don't have to watch it. Come on.

Okay.

Stop it Mike.

Needed an outsider. The package boy knows everyone. He'd spot our hitters a mile away.

Well he's the one shooting up all his guys, right? He's scared of the kid. Says he's real good, got every available gun in the city up there.

Up his house. I don't know what's going on but I know it's gotta have something to do with this kid.

Don't start with your shit. Don't you talk to me. Oh, hey Uncle Gussy, thanks for years of service. Here's a gold watch and a job sniffing other guys' shit eight hours a day. What am I, a retired bus driver?

The Duke?  What did you do?

Yes mother.

Aye.

Look in the trash around their hands. See if you can find me two bullet casings. 45's, if my eye serves me right. Don't disturb them. Mark them as they lay. Newman, root through this shit.  If this was a sink find me some metal parts. Gimme a faucet or a drain cover or something.

I can't find the second one, sir.

Got it.

Well, not armed. If they had guns, they'd have used them. But dangerous? Oh yeah.

Any tips on where these guys may be?

You're not being charged. It's up to you. Do you want to talk to them?

Let's do him right here.

Certainly illustrates the diversity of the word.

Get a hold of yourself, man.

Yes.

Fuck it! I'm doing it. I deserve it. I've been working for those fat bastards since I was in high school and look at this place.

Shit. She's on every drug know to man. She'd have sold that thing for a dime bag. Screw her.  But I do kinda feel like an ass-hole.

Listen. Something's been bothering me about last night.

Well... what if your boss knew how many guys were supposed to be there... in that room?

Think about it man. Nine men, six bullets.

He probably knew you'd end up nailing the fat guy, maybe one or two more, but he had to know you weren't walking out of there. Figure it out. Shooter's dead on the scene. No in-depth investigation. It'd slide right off his back. 'Cause as much as I love ya, you're not exactly Don Corleone. What would he be losing? A thirty- five year old delivery boy?

He knows you, man. He knows all you want is to move up. That's all. A smooth hitter woulda gone in there, seen it was a wash and slipped out. But a guy like you? Knowin' this is your only chance? Waitin' eighteen years?

Do me a favor and roll it around for a bit on your way in.

Lakeview the deli? Oh, shit!

Fuck, man! I may as well have posted flyers. Right out in public, man.

This place is like a scumbag yard sale.

No way. I've been waitin' for this asshole.

Forget it. It's a family prayer. My father, his father before him that sort of shit.

Fuck you! I told you I never saw him before!

I know what the fuck he looks like!

This guy is very sharp. If he hasn't figured us out yet, he will.

Okay, just calm down. He could hurt us, brother. He could ruin the whole thing.

You won't do it Connor, you won't. You love me man.

We're here brother.

Connor, is that you?

Mother, what are you sayin'? You're talkin' crazy here.

I want ta tell ya one last thing before I pull the trigger.

BLAME...

Well, you know how it is with him. Always complainin' he's never turnin' a profit on St. Patty's. Whole damn family goes down there with no money, cause we know he can't bear ta charge us.

What... the dirty bitch! I hope ya trounced her a good one!

Well, there's my boys.  Shit. I gotta go. Looks like I caused a ruckus with that shot. Half the damn neighborhood is comin'.

Come on, ma. Out with it. Who came out first?

We... met them last night.

So you're telling me it was one guy with six guns? A-and he was a senior fucking citizen?

Be careful.

An F.B.I. agent came by the bar. He left me his c-c, he left me his c-c, he left me this.

Fuck!

Ass!

Aye.

How many?

Shut it. It's Ma.

Lord have mercy. That was a good one ma.

I gave him his first lesson in sensitivity toward the fairer sex just today.

He got beat up by a girl.

Don't c-cross the road if ya can't get out of the kitchen.

Yeah, it's St. Patty's day. Everyone's Irish tonight. Now, why don't ya pull up a stool and have a drink with us?

"I'm afraid we can't let that one go, Ivan."

Italian.

German.  Not in our neighborhood, man. A hundred percent Irish. No one talks to cops. Period.

No pictures, either.

...so that which is good may flourish

For what?

What?

Oh, you've lost it, haven't ya?

Me too. That's stupid. Name one thing we're gonna need it for.

What is all this "they" shit? This ain't a movie.

All right, get the stupid fuckin' rope.

Just like on TV.

We'll find it. Just calm down.

Asshole!? I'm not the rope-totin' Charlie Bronson wanna-be that's getting' us lost!

Aye.

Yeah, and ya gotta shoot at him for ten minutes.

Yes, we are.

Yes.

Holy shit. Who? How many?

I'm strangely comfortable with it.

So, when are you getting a plastic fuck doll?

Rocco, this is the real deal. We must kill without hesitation, without guilt or remorse. Evil man, dead man.

A-fuckin'-men!

And he is one smart man.

He's a good man.

With every breath we shall hunt them down.

Do not kill, do not rape, do not steal. These are principles which every man of every faith can embrace.

There are varying degrees of evil. We urge you lesser forms of filth  Not to push the bounds and cross over into true corruption... into our domain.

And we will send you to whatever God you wish.

Okay then... let's get ya started.

Rule of thumb?

Do you know where that term comes from? In the early 1900's it was legal for men to beat their wives as long as they used a stick no wider than their thumb.

Oh, come on now Rozengurtle. I was just tryin' ta get a rise outta ya.

Now look Rozengurtle, we're sorry. Just relax.

Yeah, well... I'm an expert in name- ology.

Uh... two shooters!

That depends. You either do your job or get ethical.

Can she I.D. them?

Nah, too quick half their infrastructure got taken out at the Copley plaza. Besides, if you're a hitter, you're either working for the Russians or the Italians. There's no riding the fence. Our little theory from last night just got blown to shit. Something... new is going on here.

No. This guy is big time.  These two are street-walking scum.

That's just fucking weird. I have no idea.

Rocco!

Where's my cat?

You... oh god, why?

You killed my... my...

My, my...

Pee...Per...Man.

It was... It was...

Really want to know?

These guys were pros. I think they were coming for one target, the fag man, he was the...

The fat man.

He was the only one done right. Two in the back of the head.

The Sicilians.

They shot him at a downward angle.  They put him on his knees.

What about one guy with two guns?

It's gonna look like the bad guys are killing each other.

What?

Why was I not informed of this?

Crime of passion. He just went nuts. He would have shot everyone in here. He just ran out of bullets.

Well, we didn't get any help on that. A lot of people saw it. Nobody's talking.

Brilliant. So now we got a Huge guy theory and Serial crusher theory. Top fucking notch.  What's your name?

Sweet-n-low!

Why do you always disrespect me like that?

Eight.

Shit! Shit!

It tells us that he was the last to die. All these men  Were carrying. They came in, dropped all in seconds and then took their time with fag man. Didn't they, Duffy?!  They sure as fuck did!

Witness?

Who were the victims?

I got it ta my head now. I got it ta my head now.

I...

Just called ta torture us did ya?

Well you tell him ta take it easy with that. He's gotta learn ta respect women the way Connor does.

We're like 7-Eleven. We ain't always doing business, but we're always open.

Who says that? You could take credit on it.

Use your brain for once. Is it so unbelievable they don't care about you? You are fuckin' dead, you go in there today. Dead!

I'll be back at 9:00.

I'm fuckin' fine.  Catch you on the flip side.

Hey, Murph.

This is some crazy shit, man!

Y'know it is, a bit.

So?

Well, what'ya do?

Fine! Fuck it! When we're done she can I.D. me. I don't care. Just tryin' to be professional, but no...

Fuck you both! Ya ask me, he was aiming at you!

We have to go now.  We're on the lamb.

Y-Yes my son.

It's ethics. I put evil men behind bars, but the law has miles of red tape and loopholes for these... cocksuckers to slip through. I've found out there are these two young men who fix the situation with an iron fist. As if they have God's permission. But what they do is wrong and I should arrest them... technically.

You feel? A soul is what gives you feelings. Happiness, guilt, right or wrong. It is a conduit through which the Lord speaks to us. You felt that your answers would be here in the house of God today. You feel these men are necessary. The Lord has spoken to you twice this day.

You have entered the house of the Lord of your own free will speaking of beliefs and feelings. Is it so much to believe that God has brought you here?

It is easy to be sarcastic about religion. It is harder to take small hints from God, your feelings and listen to them... to take a stand.

You know them personally?

Do you think they would harm an innocent man, for any reason?

Yes! Yes! I was thinking that, too. No. I was feeling it. All I needed was to hear you say it! Amen! I'll help them.

Thank you, Father, thank you.  Whatever. Goodbye, amen.

Yes.

I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I didn't see.

That's who I'm doing this for, now open the fuckin' thing.

God have mercy on my soul.

What do you want me to say?

How long since your last confession, my son?

Just go!

The... The funny man.

Uh. Okay... um... you hear the one about the, no fuck that one... uh... oh! oh! Well... shit. Okay, there's a white guy. He's walkin' along the beach and he finds a, a pot, y'know and ah, he rubs it and this genie pops out. But this genie, he's a ni... he's a black guy.

Yeah. And uh, he's pissed off. He says, "Why you crackers always gotta find my mother fuckin' pot? And he tells him he's gonna grant all his three wishes but he's gonna give all the black guys...

He says, "What's your third wish?" And the guys says, "I-I want you to beat me half to death."

Joey Bevo said it was important. Said I had to give it to him myself.

Fuck you Vincenzo.

I caught your show down at the velvet room at the Holiday Inn, loved it when you busted into Viva Las Vegas.

Black hair. Paul Michael Glaser.

Right. The blond guy.

No. It's a real episode. The killer is leading him across the city by calling different pay phones.

As part of his plan. I don't know why.

The point is the killer always goes, May I speak to Starsky? He says his name.

He says. This is he.

Kind of. Except we've already got the keys.

She's an attractive older woman.

What do you think the cops have?

But Dignan, do you really know that much about rare coins?

Every valuable item in the house was on that list.

Yeah, but I can't be sorting through that shit in the middle of a burglary. There's just not time for it.

I don't appreciate you ridiculing me.

Yeah, I saw it.

Dignan, it's got an alarm.

That sets it off.

Yeah, I heard that.

Eight dollars.

Hang on a second.

Just turn right here.

Nothing. Go ahead.

No, Dignan. It's not your gun. It's all of ours.

You're out! I'm not working with either one of you!

You're right. You're right.

We know there's another stocker.

Unlock that door.  Check the aisles.

Oh, shit. That was scary. In the middle of the robbery. The manager looks at me. Right in the eye. And goes, I'm going to remember you.

Like he meant it.

What do you think?

He was the driver, Dignan. He did what he's supposed to do.

Don't even say it, man.

Because my mom gets the bill.

I don't want to use it.

I keep it for emergencies.

Look at the treads on those.

They obviously weren't designed for racing.

You've never had a pair of fast shoes in your life, Dignan.  In fifth grade Dignan used to wear cowboy boots for P.E.

Don't call me spoiled, Dignan.

On your marks...  Get set go.

No, I'm not saying her. I'm just saying, I don't know.

I know. But once you get inside you're home free.

It's not a plan. It's just --

Yeah, but you wouldn't have the truck if you blew it up.

Then you're going to have to dye it, Anthony. We've got to hide our identities. Especially after Bob crashed the car.

Even if it's the difference between some trooper recognizing us and throwing us in prison or not?

No. We didn't.

Hi.

Jerry.  And this is my associate Cornelius.

Sure.

What. What's the matter?

No. I didn't. Dignan, they don't speak English.

No. Not really. Inez speaks a little.

On the left.

No kidding.

No, no. Look. OK. Let's stay here until we find out what's going on.

As long as he gets out OK.

Bob?

This was in fourth grade.

After that my parents never let me go to Dignan's again.

Yes... It's true.

Where was it parked?

We said 48 hours.

This morning.

You were asleep.

He told me because he wanted to know if I wanted to go.

Bob went to help his brother. I understand that and I can't help it if you don't.

If you say so.

I didn't realize you had such an incredible ability to feel sorry for yourself, Dignan.

No. I'm going to swim. I'll see you later.

OK.

Can you hand me those french fries.

I don't really feel like talking about it. The only thing I feel like is getting the fuck out of this place.

What I'm saying is she wouldn't go for that.

I don't know, Dignan. I just --

Shh.

Dignan. I can't do that. All right? I just can't.

Bob taught you how to get electrocuted.

Don't panic, Anthony.

You can't just run home every time things get tough. First of all, we've got enough dough to --

You're so spoiled. What is "not good" to you? Only a few hundred --

That's not correct.

I know.

How much?

Shut up!

Ah. Couple days ago.

You really hit a guy with a bottle?

Who's Mr. Henry?

Right now.

Let me feel that.

He seems pretty good.

Get out of the way.

Easy, Dignan. It's OK.

What the fuck are we doing out here?

I'm sorry, Bob.

I did.

Yeah. It's pretty good.

Hopefully this trip'll go a little smoother than the last one.

Did that hurt?

I don't think you will.

Look, you're going to do fine. It's OK to be scared.

He was all right.

As a person?

Yes. I do.

Go ahead, Bird Dog.

Hang on a second.

Take your second position.

Any activity?

Stand by, Bird Dog.

Check the fucking elevator. It's moving.

Nobody move!

Careful. Check his pulse.

It's the fire alarm. Somebody pulled the fire alarm.

I don't know.

Let's go. Come on.

Come on, Kumar.

I'll see you there.

I'll see you there.

I'll get him.

Yes, there is. Let's get organized.

I don't think so.

Can't remember shit. CRS.

I don't think so. I mean. Actually, he robbed Bob's house.

Yeah.

I'm not kidding.

Pretty much everything.

We haven't heard from Applejack since he got out of the hospital. His case got dismissed.

We're not sure.

What do you mean?

It belongs to Bob's uncle.

Behind Bob's house.

We're not sure yet. It's going to need some repairs.

What can I say? It's jail. You don't sleep when you want to. You don't eat when you want to.

You're kidding.

How?

Dignan, I --

What?

Dignan, I --

Nice to meet you.

Thanks.

It's called a racquet, Anthony, and you're holding it wrong. That's ghetto play. Hold it like this.

Grammar.

Technique. That's right. Seventy- five percent of your job is crowd control. Seventy-five percent. Do you believe that?

So do I.

What do you mean what kind of person? He's a good person.

I don't think you're giving him enough credit. I know sometimes he doesn't think an idea through. He gets too excited. But --

Take a deep breath.

It feels good.

Yes, he did.

That sounds like Dignan.

Me?

I don't want to die.

Yeah. I mean, I don't think about it all the time. But once in awhile I kind of go, Woah. Man.

Death.

Are you afraid to die, Mr. Henry?

I want to ask a favor, boys. One day, when I'm long gone and all but forgotten, make one last toast to Abe Henry. And remember me as a friend.

Yeah.

Can I ask you something, Mr. Henry?

Why'd you want to help us?

Who?

Pot is an herb. It's just like any type of gardening.

But he's got a loud bark. That's the most important thing is a loud bark.

Let them fight.

Yeah. He said that.

See you, Bob.

There's a million places to hide around here.

I hope not.

Move.

OK, Dad.
